Went here on a Friday night after seeing all the great reviews for this place. We live in Logan Square so we were pretty excited to find an Indian restaurant with such high ratings. First thought walking in was how clean it was and how nice it smelled. It wasn't the smell of spices or food, but rather, the smell of some sort of incense. It was delightful. Now, onto the most important part -- the food. 

For appetizer and drinks, we ordered the vegetable samosas and mango lassi. I've always been a huge lassi fan and this did not disappoint. Only complaint was that it was a little on the small side. Vegetable samosas were really good and came out super quick and hot. 

For our main course, we ordered lamb tikka masala and butter chicken to share. Both were absolutely delicious. The amount of spices were spot on, the meats were tender, and the sauces were creamy perrrrrfection. 

The service was quick and attentive. Our water glasses were always filled and to top it off, this place is BYOB!

Solid delivery option for the area. 

Though I enjoy Rangoli, I enjoy having other options for Indian delivery. Glad to see Indian options increasing west of Ashland. Spice Room definitely lives up to its name. Not only do many of the food items come pretty spicy with good heat, but they're pretty damn flavorful as well.

So sometimes we're basic and just want butter chicken. They do butter chicken really well here. Maybe "classic" is a better term here than basic? Ok, let's say we like to go classic and get butter chicken. And it's good. Robust flavor and decent heat. Also, this place has some tasty aloo mutter. I usually order mutter paneer, but I have switched my allegiance to aloo mutter because of Spice Room's dish.

One day we'll come in and dine as we have been quite pleased with delivery service.

4.5 is what I'm giving this place, and the .5 off is just comparing to a few other Indian restaurants I have tried.  

Went here on a Saturday night for dinner when friends were out of town and I wanted some good and simple butter chicken.  

Walked in about six and the place was relatively empty.  Waitress brought menu and took my The quickly.  

Butter chicken, rice, and naan came quickly. Butter chicken came in a small-ish service, in comparison to a couple of other place, but was good and had good flavor. Chicken was tender and and again had good flavor. Not too hot, just nicely seasoned. Naan was good, hot, and a little crisp.  Pro tip: unlike some places, rice comes with the entree and the rice is more than enough for one and more like two. 

Service was good and prices were standard for Indian faire in Chicago, about $20 for main course and naan. 

Place was very clean and they were playing some fun music which made the place have a light a d fun atmosphere.  Will be back for sure.

Came in on a Saturday night. Waited maybe 5 minutes and got a table for two. During peak hours this place gets LOUD. not just loud but LOUD which makes talking with your dinner partner a little difficult. The host took our orders and 50 minutes later our food arrived. We did end up ordering samosas which came out almost immediately because the wait was getting long. When the food did come out it was fantastic. We ordered the chicken madras and malai kofta. The flavors were rich, the servings were good size, and they brought out rice. We also got an order of aloo paratha which tasted homemade. All in all this is a good option for Indian in Chicago but outside of downtown. Maybe not my go to, but very good.

Very Impressive. 

I had been meaning to try this place for a long time - as i continued my search for good 'desi' food that was anywhere close to the brilliance we have back home.

I came with a group of 4 to a completely empty restaurant at about 3pm.

For appetizer, we ordered the Chicken Malai TIkka. Now in Pakistan this would be in the BBQ section and never in the appetizer section. In theory though it made enough sense, BBQ type sharing plates for appetizers and curry for main courses.. Maybe thats how they do it in India when it comes to fine dining? This style is unheard of in Pakistan, and it doesnt make sense to me that India could be much different, but you never know. It could also be an edit to suit American audiences. 

Anyway, the Malai Tikka arrived. It was gorgeous and took me straight back to Pakistan. Malai means creamy in Urdu and this dish was perfectly creamy and the pieces were cooked to absolute perfection. I just wish it could be a main course item like back home. Being an appetizer, it was a really small portion and felt odd to eat on its own, without the rest of our food.

For our main course we ordered the Butter Chicken, Chicken Chettinad and Lamb Bogan Josh. We ordered a bunch of naan for the table and glasses of the Rose Lassi and Mango Lassi. 

The curries were delicious. This is one of the best Butter Chickens in the city. The Chicken Chettinad is a dish from the south of India and as goes with tradition from that part, uses coconut and heavy spices - this dish was HOT but beautifully cooked as well. The Lamb Bogan Josh was a bit of a let down in the sense that though the lamb was beautifully cooked, the curry didnt have a distinct flavor. Maybe ask the server for a different combination of entrees when you go so you have some variety in flavor. 

Naans were soft, fluffy and wonderful. Everything was served promptly and piping hot. Mango Lassi was standard but the Rose lassi was a first for me. The hint of rose flavor made this a really yummy drink and a nice aromatic yogurt inspired beverage goes really well with spicy curries.

For dessert we ordered the Mango Kulfi and it was a show stopper. What a dessert! Took me back to Pakistan and tasted like traditional mangoes!

All in all i had a really nice experience here. The food was delicious, navigation was easy and there was a lot of free street parking nearby.

So what keeps me from giving this spot 5 stars and suspend my search for spectacular Pakistani/indian food?

1 - I need everything that is in the appetizer section to be separate entrees, up-sized in a new BBQ section. Doing this will take this restaurant to spectacular heights. All these "appetizers" need to be proper dishes.

2- This place isnt really THAT cheap, so when the server refused to split the check more than 2 ways, it was a little disappointing. You can expect to spend at least $20 - $25 here. We were 4 people and they wouldn't split a $100 check more than 2 ways. This makes a big difference when people decide if they will return to a restaurant again.

Solid Indian food, great staff at a reasonable price.  Compared to other places, so far, this is one of my favs.  Love their veggie samosas. Classic and just good.  We ordered the Channa Masala (spicy) and Chicken Tikka Masala, with a side of basmati rice and of course garlic naan.  The space is cute and quaint, not a huge area, but they make the most of it.  it is a BYOB which is awesome.  Food was just spot on, spicy enough for this Korean girl that needs her spice, and it wasn't oily.  I find a lot of Indian dishes that have a lake of oil sitting on top.  The garlic naan came out warm and delicious.  They were on top of the service too, refilling waters like no ones business and always coming around to see if we needed anything.  Super friendly and even funny.  I would definitely recommend and go back without hesitation.

I came here recently in for a late lunch with some friends after my brother found this place on Yelp.

The first impression was good. There's a lot of natural light in the place and their front windows open completely to make it feel more outdoorsy. 

The food was very good. We had Chettinad and Butter Chicken. I would also recommend the Rose Lassi, I had it and it was amazing. The Mango Kulfi was very good too, it had the fresh Mango flavor which is hard to find.

They lose a star for me though because we had a $100 cheque before gratuity and we wanted to split it 4 ways but they would only accept two cards. This is always a downer for me, especially with a cheque this big. The simple truth is that as someone who eats out often and almost always in a group, it is for this sole reason that I'll be hesitant to come back here.

I'll keep this short, Five Stars all around. Everything is amazing. I order here at least once a month. Delivery and Dine In both have the same great quality of food. The best Indian food in Chicago, hands down.
VEGGIE SAMOSA, Amazing
CHICKEN TIKKA, Bomb
 CURRY LAMB, YUM
 GARLIC NAAN, FANTASTIC

Amazing! 

The only reason it's not a 5 star rating is because of location.  It's not "close" to transit or in a particularly interesting part of town but that doesn't stop me from going there almost every week!  For what the location lacks, the food makes up for.  

Here's some of my favorite things about spice room:

It's BYOB
Most entrees come with rice 
They will adjust the spice level if you ask 
Allergies (ingredients are listed for each item)
They take reservations

Almost everything on their menu is great so don't be afraid to try something new!  I highly recommend their chicken tikka (it's in the appetizer section), the butter chicken is a must (it's nut-free), garlic naan, and the aloo paratha.

We had heard such good things about this place from other friends and we were not disappointed.
A group of 4 of us went last weekend. 

The restaurant has double doors in the front that open up to the sidewalk which gave it a cool breeze. 

We had reservations and were promptly seated.  The place is BYOB so we brought a couple bottles of wine.  Our server was very polite and attentive.  While we were all familiar with the dishes they served he did take the time to go over any questions we had.  

For apps we order the Gobi Manchurian and Samosa both of which were very delicious, I would go back just for those two.

For dinner we had the butter paneer, dhal and our friends some chicken dishes.  My favorite was the butter paneer as the paneer was cooked perfectly and came out nice and soft.  

All of the food that came out was prepared well and tasted delicious.  The good thing about spice room is that they don't charge you extra for rice with your curry as a lot of other places do.

We will definitely be coming back here.  A must try if you want great Indian food without going all the way up to Devon.

Wow. So far I've gone 3 days for takeout back to back. So good! Fresh and healthy. All of what I have had a chance to order has been excellent. The Naan bread had been delicious however one of the days the naan was burnt all throughout the bottom. Other than that mistake everything has been excellent and I will return (and I'll check my naan before leaving with my takeout) easy 5 stars.

I came here on one of the hottest days of the year, and the front windows were open to the sidewalk. Having the hot breeze along with the Indian food meant all of the customers were sweating their butts off!
I ordered the vegetarian samosas, butter chicken, saag paneer, raita, and regular naan. The meal came with rice along with it. All of the food was prompt in coming out, and even when we asked for raita or extra naan, they came out almost immediately. The samosas were great, very hot and flavorful. I wish there was more sauce to go along with them though! 
Both the butter chicken and saag paneer were good, but a bit mild to me. We weren't asked the spice level, so if I came here again I would ask for things more spicy. Overall, solid meal but I wasn't blown away by anything. 
Service was amazing, they were prompt in everything. Our waters were always full! Also this is BYOB, and there is a market right across the street!

First of all I'd like to thank all of you Yelper for helping me find a great indian restaurant to take my sister to! I did not know of this place until I started searching up restaurants on yelp. And reading all the reviews, I decided that I had to check this place out! Unfortunately I haven't tried any other Indian restaurants that I could compare this place to but since I am Indian I can compare it to tradition homemade Indian food and I'd say this place is pretty good! 

My sister and I got to the place around 8pm and it was pretty packed! But we lucked out and got a table in like 20 mins. I loved the atmosphere! All the staff members and customers were super friendly. I loved the seating arrangement at the restaurant because it encouraged customers to talk to each other. My sister and I ended up conversing with a couple who recommended so many other places around logan square to checkout! There is very little space between the tables which encourages mingling.

Order 
Appetizer: Chicken Malai Tikka 
This was basically bite size pieces of chicken seasoned and served with freshly chopped onions, carrots and cilantro. It was great! But in my opinion could have been seasoned a little more. 

Entree/Main Course: Chicken Biryani 
It was decent! The serving size was pretty large. I feel like the plate can easier be split between at least two people. 

Entree/Main Course: Mango chicken Curry 
You can select the spice level you want and since everything else was not as strongly seasoned as I had hoped, I thought getting the spiciest one would be a good idea. It WAS NOT. I started tearing up because of the spice! I still loved this dish but if I were to try this a second time I will definitely go for the medium spice level. 

Side: Garlic Naan
This was my first time trying Garlic Naan and it won't be my last! It was amazing!! 

Did not try desserts or drinks from here.

This is a byob restaurant so majority of the customers did bring wine. 

Overall I thought the food was good. Bathroom was super clean. Environment was very relaxed and easy going. Music was covers of popular english songs remixed with indian style beats and I loved it. 

If I do end up going back here, I would say it would be more for of the atmosphere/vibe of the restaurant but the food was still pretty good!

This is a new neighborhood favorite and I'm SO thrilled Logan finally has a very formidable Indian place. 

Let's see...the samosas are spot on. The malai kofta is the stuff dreams are made of (probably one of the best things I've ever eaten), and the butter chicken is solid. Everything is super flavorful. I typically find myself literally licking the dishes clean. Embarrassing but true. The dishes do run on the spicy side so I always ask for the mild version. 

I've done dine in and carry out and have been happy with both. BYOB is great and while the decor isn't anything to write home about, it's a nice little unpretentious spot that is good for a small group. 

The only downside to this spot is that the prices are on the high side. But, the food is so damn good I don't care.

We are Indian and have tried nearly every restaurant in Chicago so I was excited to see a new one pop up. Brought my parents from the suburbs. Fist off, super new that we missed it because there wasn't a sign outside. There's probably enough tables for 15 people. It was an intimate setting. We gave the owner some suggestions on maybe having some papad available since they didn't. They service was good and very responsive. Food came out in a timely fashion.  The place is byob which we didn't know. Prices are not cheap but the servings are family style. He asked is the level of spice we wanted which was great but just beware! Even for us it was a little much but very tasty. 

Hopefully they can expand their menu because they only have kulfi as dessert but everything tastes great. We got the paneer makhani, tadka dal, chicken one dry and one curry.

This place is AMAZING.  The waiters are incredibly attentive and jolly.  My boyfriend and I both tried to order the Tikka Masala (hello, uncultured white people!) but our waiter insisted on bringing me a surprise instead.  I was nervous, given that this was my first time eating at Spice House.  Would my food be too spicy?  What was this surprise?  

Food came out and BOY am I glad I put my trust in him.  He wouldn't tell me what it was (lol) but it was absolutely delicious and the envy of our table.  I asked once more when we got the check, but he simply told me "come back and ask for the special - it changes every time but it'll always be great."  And I believe him.

Also, get the garlic naan.

Live review: spicy chicken wing appetizer was delicious, but jimminy, the food is arriving at a snail's pace! This place does an incredible delivery business and we're clearly behind a number of pickup orders. 

Round 2: Oh ye of little faith: the mutter paneer and chicken vindaloo (high heat at our request) were out of this world! Several swipes of garlic naan and we were official members of The Spice Room Clean Plate Club!

Went to try this place for dinner a few week ago and I was surprised with the level of spiciness at this restaurant. It sure is authentic and true to what real Indian food is like. The place is BYOB so that's always a plus and even though it is small we did not have any problems getting seated during the week. Went there with a friend so we decided to try two different appetizers, the veggie samosas and the chicken pakora. Both apps were awesome so we started off on the right foot.

For our entrees we went with the butter chicken and the chicken vindaloo (was super spicy!!) My friend tried both but she said the chicken vindaloo was too spicy for her so that was kind of my entree. The butter chicken was really good and had some hits of spice even after she ordered hers mild. One thing to note is that the waiter will ask you what "spice" level you want so you should not be too surprised with the dishes. There is also a good variety of naan's available and the garlic naan was my favorite. Overall I truly enjoy having a good Indian restaurant in the area and the fact that I no longer have to drive out to Devon for good authentic Indian food. Can't wait to go back and try other dishes on their menu!!

I have only ordered from The Spice Room for delivery and I've been quite satisfied. Although I often specify that I want certain dishes to be spicy, it's a mixed bag, but not bad. I will have to go in for a proper sit-down because I think ordering online results in the restaurant playing it safely with spicing up food to avoid negative customer feedback.

The daal makhani is my go-to dish whenever I order. I've developed more of a love for butter chicken here and the chicken tikka masala is also a winner. The one dish that I order every time is the chicken biryani. Now, that comes spicy all the time. And rather than regular naan, I've embraced my addiction for aloo paratha. So, since I have been happy with delivery, yes, I shall have to go in and put my feet under one of the tables for an in-house dining experience.

Great Indian restaurant in Logan Square! I have enjoyed their Butter Chicken, Chicken Korma (probably my fave!), as well as their Garlic Naan (yummmmmmmmm!). Enjoying these selections really gets me exited to try more items on their menu. 

I also truly enjoy their servers. They have always been so nice to myself and my roommate. I truly enjoy this sport, that the only reason I didn't rate 5 stars is because I feel like the price is just a tad bit high (curry+rice+naan ~ $18 the last time I went). I am hoping that they may consider having a lunch buffet option at some point though, because I would DEFINITELY buy into that. :P

Found our new favorite Indian restaurant thanks to Uber Eats!  Ordered delivery during a rainstorm and the food was amazing so we went for dinner the very next evening!  Best veggie samosas in the city! Chicken Madras and chicken tikka masala both on point. Owner is super friendly and working the room. Looking forward to returning to try something new!

Place has a good vibe with a nice mix of people. It's loud and byob so bring the party and enjoy the eats here!

Been waiting for 2 hours for our food and it's still not here. To add insult to injury, we've been on hold with the restaurant and Eat24 for over 20 minutes while they're trying to figure this out. After all was said and done they gave a $3 credit on $90 order and the food is still not here. 


I wonder if they'll break the record and cross that 3 hour delivery time barrier. Exciting times. 


Update: Got our food 2 1/2 hours later and it was missing one entree. Seems about right.

Really happy that there is finally a good Indian restaurant by Logan/Humboldt. I got the chana masala and it was perfect. My friends got meat dishes and loved their food as well. I definitely recommend it.

You need to take a shower Spicy Vs. You are sweating Spicy. 

I LOVED THIS PLACE. 


I went a 2 of my girlfriends, and we shared all the dishes. We ordered, Chicken Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan, Shrimp Korma, and the Curry Lamb. I loved that everything was actually spicy! With the exception of the Chicken Tikka, Idk why. But I always just love that dish in particular a little more mild. 
Anyways the man that was helping us throughout the menu was really great! Such a sweet man. 
We were all very excited, and just happy that the food was soooo good. 
The three of us will be back!

Pretty bummed out and disappointed by this place. I went about a week ago and the whole place was literally in chaos. At one point the smoke alarm in the kitchen was going off for about 10 minutes. They ended up having to leave the back door open in order to prevent that from happening again I guess so I ended up eating my meal in the cold.

It also took over an hour for the food to come to us. Our waitress forgot to put in our order. She gave us the wrong order at first, and then when we told her that it wasn't what we ordered she tried to insist that she was. Finally she realized that she made a mistake but of course apologizing was going to be too difficult for her.

We finally ended up getting our food and of course by then our rice was cold. The chicken was dry. The flavors were good but it didn't make up for the dry chicken or the abysmal service and atmosphere.

The prices are also incredibly high. You pay about $15-16 for some type of chicken dish and that doesn't even include rice...

Was originally super excited about this place but most likely will not be coming back.

I have only ordered from The Spice Room for delivery and I've been quite satisfied. Although I often specify that I want certain dishes to be spicy, it's a mixed bag, but not bad. I will have to go in for a proper sit-down because I think ordering online results in the restaurant playing it safely with spicing up food to avoid negative customer feedback.

The daal makhani is my go-to dish whenever I order. I've developed more of a love for butter chicken here and the chicken tikka masala is also a winner. The one dish that I order every time is the chicken biryani. Now, that comes spicy all the time. And rather than regular naan, I've embraced my addiction for aloo paratha. So, since I have been happy with delivery, yes, I shall have to go in and put my feet under one of the tables for an in-house dining experience.

Great Indian restaurant in Logan Square! I have enjoyed their Butter Chicken, Chicken Korma (probably my fave!), as well as their Garlic Naan (yummmmmmmmm!). Enjoying these selections really gets me exited to try more items on their menu. 

I also truly enjoy their servers. They have always been so nice to myself and my roommate. I truly enjoy this sport, that the only reason I didn't rate 5 stars is because I feel like the price is just a tad bit high (curry+rice+naan ~ $18 the last time I went). I am hoping that they may consider having a lunch buffet option at some point though, because I would DEFINITELY buy into that. :P

Found our new favorite Indian restaurant thanks to Uber Eats!  Ordered delivery during a rainstorm and the food was amazing so we went for dinner the very next evening!  Best veggie samosas in the city! Chicken Madras and chicken tikka masala both on point. Owner is super friendly and working the room. Looking forward to returning to try something new!

Place has a good vibe with a nice mix of people. It's loud and byob so bring the party and enjoy the eats here!

Been waiting for 2 hours for our food and it's still not here. To add insult to injury, we've been on hold with the restaurant and Eat24 for over 20 minutes while they're trying to figure this out. After all was said and done they gave a $3 credit on $90 order and the food is still not here. 


I wonder if they'll break the record and cross that 3 hour delivery time barrier. Exciting times. 


Update: Got our food 2 1/2 hours later and it was missing one entree. Seems about right.

Indian food in Logan! Loved this restaurant. We were able to get a table right before they closed and they were nice enough to still serve us and not make us feel rushed at all. The restaurant is smaller so it is a nice intimate setting. We also love BYOB. And the spice was great! We had samosa which were delicious and shared veg. tikka masala between two people. Again, the spice level was excellent and made us sweat a little. Portion size was great. We will definitely be back.

Logan Square was lacking in Indian restaurants but finally that has been solved! The Spice Room is the best new addition to Armitage. The food was some of the best Indian I have had anywhere. Very vegetarian friendly with both appetizers and entrees. Definitely get the gobi Manchurian, samosas and the veg korma. 

In addition the the food, the service goes above and beyond. The waiter was extremely friendly and willing to help with suggestions of what to try. They will accommodate to everyone's liking of spice level.  It's also a plus that it's BYOB! 

If you love Indian or if you haven't tried it before  I highly suggest coming here. You won't be disappointed!

Authentic Indian food in Logan Square. However, I've tried Spice Room twice now; once at the restaurant and another time I ordered delivery -both times the food was too spicy. And I requested mild for sure the last time. My Pakistani friend even said it was a tad too spicy for him. Tone down the heat a little and everything will be perfect!

(Update: 10/20/2017) It appears the Spice Room got the message and applies spice according to your request now. Bravo! Adding an additional star.

If you love Indian food you have to try the spice room. This isn't Americanized fake Indian food with toned down flavors; this was the real deal delicious.  I had the bagara chicken and my fianc had the butter chicken - both were super flavorful and the bagara chicken was just spicy enough. We also got garlic naan which was of course amazing.  They gave us more than enough food, and honestly, I was a little angry when we finished our leftovers cause I wanted more!

The service was awesome and friendly, and our waiter gave excellent recommendations. The decor was very simple, but pleasant.  This spot is BYOB, but if you show up without a beverage you can walk to the store right across the street and grab a bottle. It's definitely worth a try, and I'll definitely go back!

Having the opportunity to work in London, I've had an incredible array of some of the worlds best Indian food. 

I'm confused by some of the reviews being left in regards to the service--after dining here two nights in one week, it's clear the staff takes significant pride in what they're doing. They are knowledgeable on the dishes and spices and are happy to make recommendations to suit your dietary preference.  

Experiencing the complex flavor and slow building heat that many of their dishes offer, I am reliving my time in London. 

We will be back soon as we make our way through the menu - progressing in heat as we go... I prefer to sweat, not shower (but they can make either happen). 

My recommendation is to start with the Gobi Manchurian and move your way to a Tikka Masala with a side of Garlic Naan.  

BYOB and FoodSmart is across the street with a great wine selection. Considering the previous restaurants who have occupied this space, this is an incredible addition the neighborhood.

Oh, so good!  We were craving authentic Indian food while in Chicago and found this place on Yelp.  They had just opened 3 months ago.  The place is not well marked, but you'll find it by all the people eating there and/or waiting outside.  Food was excellent and spicy as advertised.  Heed the warning from other Yelp reviewers.  We had butter chicken, lamb curry, a vegetable curry, garlic naan, regular naan, and added tandoori chicken.  Rice comes with the meal, which is awesome!  And how it should be!  Tandoori chicken was spicy as well so be prepared.  The service was very friendly and helpful, going out of their way to make sure we had a good experience by telling us frequently when our table would be ready and suggesting entrees that would go well together.  It's bring your own alcohol, so thought it was cool that most tables had wine and beer from across the street.  Very comfortable atmosphere and fun place to eat out.  You gotta go!

This is my new fave place for Indian food. My best friend just moved into an apt down the street so we walked here for dinner. It was packed so we already knew it was gonna be good! They don't have a sign yet so it's easy to miss but you can definitely smell the food when you're half a block away because the whole front of the restaurant is open.

*It's byob (yay!)
*The lamb vindaloo was the hottest I've ever had. I love it - be careful though because I have a high tolerance and it made me sweat a little lol. 
*The servers were all very attentive despite how busy it was. Our water cups were never empty. This is especially important because we were downing our water very quickly. 

We also got garlic naan which was nice and garlicky. I can't wait to go back again. *drool*

Both dishes were rich and had a variety of spices. Delivery was fast and easy (and I believe available past the hours of their dining room). I would absolutely order from here again and, honestly, probably will. I'd also love to dine in and get the full experience.

I ordered shrimp tikka Marsala but was kind of disappointed at the portion of shrimp.  5 small pieces for $14? No thanks.  My boyfriend had the lamb vindaloo and it was just WAY too hot.  He is a champ with hot food too so this kicked his ass.

I've had samosas all over London.  It's my favorite street food there.   These are far better, and the tamarind sauce is magnificent with the keema samosas.   

The service is gleeful, just short enough of fawning so as to be endearing.   These folks are proud of their place, and it shows.   They treat you like an honored guest in their home, and it is quite pleasant.   

The buttered naan is joyfully good, with crisp spots that are not burned (as some flatbreads are).  

I loved this place.

I found the spice room via yelp as a "hot & new" restaurant, I love Indian food so I tested out the classic butter chicken, garlic naan, the ground lamb samosas and the lamb curry. 
The samosas were on point and they provided us with a tamarind and a mint/cilantro sauce.  The butter chicken left something to be desired..a combo of too much tomato sauce and no spice. However, the lamb curry was AMAZING and I highly recommend it! The garlic Naan needed more garlic as well. Overall the service was great, very kind, generous, and responsive. The decor was clean and contemporary, as well as enough seating for 2,4 or a party of 6. Oh and it's BYOB!

YES!  This place is amazing.  Such a treat to now have in the neighborhood, especially after a couple of consecutive lousy places at that location.  Hope Spice Room stays for a long time.  Could the dishes be a little cheaper?  Maybe?  But it's BYOB.  Think of the money they're not making there = you are saving. Go across the street and grab a 6 pack or bottle of wine for $10 and everybody wins. The hot here is definitely hot.  What do you expect?  And it was GOOD.  We had the lamb vindaloo and it was on fire.  So good.  We had 3 dishes, paneer butter masala (mild), this green chile and coconut sauce chicken dish (medium/hot) and the vindaloo which was en fuego. And delicious. Get some yogurt sauce to calm it down (highly recommend anyway) and garlic or butter naan.  Will be back again soon.  Curious to check out how it comes when you get takeout/delivery.

I'm so so so happy to have a good Indian restaurant in the neighborhood! I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they survive in that seemingly cursed location. ^^; (There were more people in there on a Monday night than I think I've seen in any previous restaurant in that location put together, so I think they'll do ok.)

For the last several years I've been pretty devoted to Cumin, but recently they changed... something. Chef, recipes, processes, something. My favorite dish no longer tastes the same, and not in a good way, so I crossed them off my list of regular places. When I got to the Spice Room last night, I was excited to find the same dish on their menu (lamb madras). And let me say, I was NOT disappointed! It was not the same madras that I was used to, but that's just fine with me. For the first time I could really taste the coconut in the sauce, and also it was beautifully spicy?! Have I been missing out this whole time??? The garlic naan was wonderful and the samosa, well, it's a samosa. I was impressed at the spice level of the green dipping sauce though... wow! They really aren't messing around. I'm definitely coming back again. 

My only complaint is that the servers seemed a bit clueless. I was seated and had my order taken right away. Food came fairly promptly. Water was refilled regularly. But even after I was very clearly done, no one came to check on me. I had to flag someone down to get carry out boxes, and then it took a while after that to get my check. Guys, if my plates are cleared and my food's boxed, you can go ahead and assume I'm ready to go. :|

This is some of the best Indian food in the city - they know how to layer on the spice and cook things to perfection. The staff is incredibly accommodating. BYOB is a huge plus. All of the dishes I've had so far have been excellent - I look forward to trying the rest of their menu.

YES!  This place is amazing.  Such a treat to now have in the neighborhood, especially after a couple of consecutive lousy places at that location.  Hope Spice Room stays for a long time.  Could the dishes be a little cheaper?  Maybe?  But it's BYOB.  Think of the money they're not making there = you are saving. Go across the street and grab a 6 pack or bottle of wine for $10 and everybody wins. The hot here is definitely hot.  What do you expect?  And it was GOOD.  We had the lamb vindaloo and it was on fire.  So good.  We had 3 dishes, paneer butter masala (mild), this green chile and coconut sauce chicken dish (medium/hot) and the vindaloo which was en fuego. And delicious. Get some yogurt sauce to calm it down (highly recommend anyway) and garlic or butter naan.  Will be back again soon.  Curious to check out how it comes when you get takeout/delivery.

I'm so so so happy to have a good Indian restaurant in the neighborhood! I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they survive in that seemingly cursed location. ^^; (There were more people in there on a Monday night than I think I've seen in any previous restaurant in that location put together, so I think they'll do ok.)

For the last several years I've been pretty devoted to Cumin, but recently they changed... something. Chef, recipes, processes, something. My favorite dish no longer tastes the same, and not in a good way, so I crossed them off my list of regular places. When I got to the Spice Room last night, I was excited to find the same dish on their menu (lamb madras). And let me say, I was NOT disappointed! It was not the same madras that I was used to, but that's just fine with me. For the first time I could really taste the coconut in the sauce, and also it was beautifully spicy?! Have I been missing out this whole time??? The garlic naan was wonderful and the samosa, well, it's a samosa. I was impressed at the spice level of the green dipping sauce though... wow! They really aren't messing around. I'm definitely coming back again. 

My only complaint is that the servers seemed a bit clueless. I was seated and had my order taken right away. Food came fairly promptly. Water was refilled regularly. But even after I was very clearly done, no one came to check on me. I had to flag someone down to get carry out boxes, and then it took a while after that to get my check. Guys, if my plates are cleared and my food's boxed, you can go ahead and assume I'm ready to go. :|

I went here when it first opened so maybe they improved since I went.  We started out with the Gobi Manchurian and it was not as flavorful as it could be.  It was also not a great deal considering the price and portion.  We had the Paneer Butter Masala and that was a winner for sure.  The tomato sauce was absolutely delightful and there were healthy chunks of paneer in there.  The saag paneer was disappointing though.  The sauce didn't taste like saag at all and was dry/not creamy.  The paneer was also barely there.  The service was average and the ambience could have been more present.  I think they could charge less but since they are in Logan they can get away with charging more perhaps.  I think it was overpriced for the food I was getting.  I am hoping they were just going through some growing pains and they have improved since.

Really enjoyed dinner here. The waiter was personable and chose just the right spice after asking our preference. I had a vegetable dumbling creamy dish (can't recall what it was called). My girlfriend had the butter chicken and she said it was very tasty. It's BYOB and we paired our meal with a ros.

Food here was fantastic.Five stars on food alone...downgraded to four stars only because the place is so new that it still needs to develop an identity for a dine-in experience. 

I was there on the second day they opened, so it was understandably slow. Nothing draws a crowd like a crowd, so they'll have to figure out how to become a dine-in destination. 

However, for the food alone, I put it on par with Rangoli and Hema's Kitchen - two of my favorites in the city for Indian food.

I came in with high hopes here and unfortunately The Spice Room didn't meet my expectations. I asked our server/the owner what I could eat off of the menu that was vegan, he marked off some dishes on the menu for me, however, they were not all vegan. I asked if any of the appetizers were vegan, he said the fried okra was. I told him I didn't like okra, but he insisted I try it and that he would bring it out (I ended up having this item on my bill). The fried okra was reaaallllly fried. I ended up going with my old faithfuls for my entree, dal tarka and aloo gobi. We asked for medium spice and we could barely eat it. It was incredibly spicy. 

Decor, boring, barely anything on the walls, the space was very sterile looking. 

Service, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but don't bring me okra when I mention that I don't like it and then charge me for it. I would have liked to see more knowledge around which entrees were vegan. 

Food. Rice and roti were great. The rest was so incredibly spicy, I could barely eat it.

Went here on its second day of existence with my West London (ie Indian Food expert) wife. We thought it was great. Some of the best Samosas I've ever had. Onion Pakoras were delicious. Lamb Rogan Josh very tasty and at "medium" spicy was just right. Obviously, order one spicy level down than what you are comfortable with. Chicken Korma was my favorite main, so creamy and great with the garlic naan. Two criticisms.... The mains do not come with rice included, and no free pappadoms to gosh on before eating. Service was at a nice leisurely pace, and owner was delightful, comping a mango lassi for our two year old. They deliver and are a great addition to the neighborhood that is so lacking in Indian food. Will be here again soon and often, highly recommend!

I've been here twice so far and everything is great! We went on a Sunday night and we got a seated easily and then we went again on a Saturday night and were seated promptly but it was definitely getting packed after we sat down. 

We ordered an assortment of items including: keema samosa (yum), chicken vindaloo (spicey), kofta makhani (rich tomato flavors with vegetable dumplings), naan (butter, garlic & plain) and kulfi with a stick (great for cooling down your palette from all the spicy foods). 

Our server both times, I think he's actually the owner, is so cute! He is so hospitable and also gave us suggestions when we were confused. 

We'll definitely be coming back!

My friend and I ordered 2 dishes to go.  Our food was ready within 15 minutes.  (While waiting, I recommend popping cross the street to FoodSmart for cocktail ingredients or desert to accompany your meal.)  

The prices are typical for the area ($10-15 for an entree) and the man taking our order was attentive and outgoing.

When we arrived home, they had mixed up the order.  Upon calling, they graciously offered for us to come in and pick up the right entree whenever we were in the area.  Mix-ups happen and they handled it very well.

Wow! This place is absolutely fantastic. Our server was very friendly and offered great suggestions. We got the samosa appetizer, the Paneer Butter Masala, the Chicken Korma, and the Onion Kulcha. The Masala was like a delightfully spiced tomato soup and the Chicken Korma was just the right amount of sweet. The samoaa and Kulcha were good but not something I'd order again. The restaurant was clean, well staffed and the experience overall was wonderful. Definitely look forward to coming here again.

This place is so cute and especially nice on a cool night since they keep the front open. Great music and fantastic service, but even better is the food! My lamb vindaloo was spicy, which I was really happy about because some places hold back on the spice. The waiters were nice enough to keep bringing me water, so many thanks for that. Even more delicious was the butter chicken. I couldn't get enough of it! Will definitely be back!

Having lived in Logan Square for 10 years now, I was very excited to hear about an Indian restaurant moving into the neighborhood. And I'll have to say, the wait was worth it. The friendly and attentive service, excellent food makes this an excellent addition the neighborhood.

We ordered the garlic naan (which is wonderful, flakey and buttery), veggie samosas, okra masala (absolutely wonderful), and chicken tikka masala (okay, we would try something different next time).

We will definitely be back, and I think it's worth a try for all those interested.  Oh, let me add, the music is great.  

Last tip: The restaurant is BYOB.  If you forget the FoodSmart is across the street which has plenty of alcohol.

Without a doubt, Spice Room exceeded my expectations in all levels. Service staff was quick, friendly, and truly authentic in their desire to please. The food was amazing; we ordered vegetarian and non-veg options with all dishes made with distinct flavors. Soooooo goood. I will be coming back. The place is really cool too! BYOB!

Very disappointed with the service, taste, portion size, and price. I placed a to go order for the Okra Masala. When the server brought me my fist size entree for $12 I said wow this better be good for this price. She gave me a spoon to taste and at first I thought it was okay but then it left an awful after taste in my mouth. I approached the kitchen to let them know that I was disappointed and to see what they could do. I was willing to either get something else or return the entree that I already purchased. They said they couldn't do that because there was not a manager there. I said so there is nothing that you can do and they said no. The young man did say he would take my name and number and give it to their manager. I live a block away and by the time I got home the taste that was left in my mouth from the food and the experience made me loose my appetite completely. I will definitely never go back here again! 
I waited over 24 hours for a phone call back from management, but never got one. I returned to the restaurant (with my untouched food) the next day at dinner time to speak to a manager. Still no manager on site, but the young man that I spoke to the day before did say his manager told him to refund my money. I find it very disappointing that management couldn't take the time to call me and make this right. I very rarely post reviews here, but when you have a negative or positive experience I think it should be shared.

The food wasn't too bad. I liked that they gave you "heat level" options to help combat the non-Indian palette. The food is pretty comparable to other Indian restaurants in the neighborhood, so if you're looking for good Indian food but want new scenery, I would give this place a try.

The service was alright, our server was a little too attentive. He jutted himself into our dinner conversation several times over the course of the meal. I'm all for attentive service, but it got to be quite awkward and uncomfortable when he would linger around. I also have a nose piercing, which he felt very inclined to make comments about. I'm sure he'll rub others the right way, but it didn't quite work for me.

Next time, I'll stick to take-out.

It was ok.  For the price actually it was good but not in a hurry to go back.  Head the chicken papiko or something.  Think deep fried chicken bites but really it was a few pieces of chicken and a lot of batter and veggies deep fried.  Gobi Manchurian was pretty good and the butter chicken was overcooked.  The sauce and spices were excellent but everything was just ok.  Garlic naan was great and white rice was on point.  I guess it's like they just need to work on it cause it could have been really good.  Oh and it's BYOB.

Best Indian I've had in Chicago - and I've searched far and wide. The prices are reasonable, the portions are just right, and the service is great. Lamb Vindaloo is very spicy - watch out. If you haven't had Malai Kofta, have it here - it's the best!

Where do I begin?! The service is AMAZING, which makes this place stand out. The food is absolutely amazing, bursting with the traditional Indian flavors that I love.  These two components combined with a lively but relaxed environment makes this one of my new favorite spots.

I really never yelp, but just to help this new business in the area.  Wow, food was fantastic, so good. I could see myself coming back again this week.  Mango chicken was amazing, their spicy lamb was, well super spicy, so be careful if you can't take the heat. Beyond that service was prompt, the owner very nice.  I look forward to seeing his restaurant shine :)

This place is amazing. Best Indian Food in the city if you ask me. Certainly the tastiest in Logan Square! I ordered the Shrimp Korma and the garlic naan and I wanted to lick the plate. BYOB only makes this place that much better!

Almost everything I've had is excellent. 
The lamb , chicken and chickpeas are highly recommended. Only problem is food can be too spicy hot for most- even mild is hot.

Its new place very delicious food, ordered pao bhaji in appetizer, the pao were very crispy and delicious perfectly toasted they adjust the spice level for you i ordered it spicy and it was indian spicy was very very hot, so the next item Paneer butter masala we ordered medium and was still quite spicy for my taste buds, so make sure to ask for spice level before ordering, but loved their food very different and flavourful. I will definitely go back to check other dishes next time

The chicken tikka masala was delicious and so was the gobi manchurian! Lamb samosas were also fantastic. Only reason it is 4 star and not 5 is that it took quite a while to get our food. Nine outside takeout drivers (from doordash and such) came in and out while we were there, so that is probably why. Totally understand it gets them more business but it made our experience slow. Overall, though, the food was great and I recommend it.

I've been living in the area for about four years now; and don't get me wrong there are some great spots to eat at, but nothing of an Indian Cusinie- until this place! 

It's literally right across the street from Foodsmart, and it's BYOB, so you can get your bottle of wine or beer and then come right in.
 
The environment was very nice; and I really enjoyed the music throughout my time there, but...

The food was really awesome.
 
My girlfriend and I got (I forgot the name of the dish) a spicy chicken entree, with some garlic nan; and honestly, its was great. Also ordered the deserts, which were also equally awesome. 

The owner/our server was such a nice and friendly guy; you could tell he really cared, and genuinely appreciated us being there.

If you're in Logan, and you want some Indian food with good service, check this spot out.

My roommate and I love Indian food and were excited to see a place open up in Logan. The portions were perfect to split, and gave us leftovers to spare. 

We ordered the lamb curry and chicken vindaloo, along with garlic naan and a mango lassi. Lovely service and great food! 

Perfect level of spice and heat. The chicken vindaloo is listed as very spicy, which I found just right as a spicy food lover. Definitely plan on coming again with more friends; it's a great spot to share.

When we got our food it was pretty basic, nothing outstanding. Would have probably ordered takeout from there if the rest of our experience went better.
They just seemed all around confused. They handed our BYOB bottle of wine to a different table, gave our check to someone else, tried handing us a different tables check, didn't know where food was going... there was only about 5 tables filled I really couldn't comprehend all the confusion.
After paying our bill they brought me back the receipt to sign without my debit card. When I asked for my card back they were MIA and then told me that they had LOST it. They didn't even offer to compensate us, I had to ask them to make it right, which they did.. kind of. They gave me the money we charged on the card back in cash but MINUS the tip that I had written in before I was told they "lost" my card. They called me after they had closed that night and I had to wait to pick it up 2 days later when I was able to make it back over there. After getting my card back there was a fraudulent charge on my account. Extremely disappointed. I am traveling tomorrow morning and will not be able to have a new card before I leave now that I had to cancel my card, which is also linked to a lot of automatic bill payments.

For the past four years, Rangoli had been our go-to Indian spot.  We thought it was even better than what we used to get when we'd drive up to Devon when we lived closer to there.  But, last summer our Rangoli take out changed.  The Tikka wasn't quite as delicious and the Chana wasn't quite as appealing.  We'd still order it, every time saying, "maybe it will be like it used to be again."  Gradually we ordered less and less.  

Then Spice House opened.  Taking it home the first time I noticed the same packaging as Rangoli used, opened it and saw the creamy orange tikka sauce and bright chana.  And yes, it tasted like Rangoli used to.  There is a reason for the similarity....

This is the best Indian nearby, and I honestly think it's the best in the city.  Be sure to try the Bhindi Masala and Malai Kofta.

This restaurant is only a month old, but if there are still kinks to be worked out, I did not see evidence of that when dining last night with a friend. The place was running like a well-oiled machine.  The interior is warm and inviting, and very clean. We were seated and provided water right away, and about 2 minutes later, the server / owner greeted us. He was so friendly and kind, and you could tell he took great pride in his restaurant. We ordered the okra appetizer and it arrived to our table in about ten minutes. We also ordered 2 delicious mains, along with rice and naan, and to drink we had rose-flavored lassi. The food here is so fresh and high quality, and they don't use too much oil, like some Indian restaurants tend to do. I have friends from southern India that say it's as authentic as you can get, and better than anything they've had on Devon. I couldn't agree more. Please note though, they don't mess around when it comes to the the heat level. If you're unsure if you can handle medium, go with mild and you'll be very happy.

Uuggghhhhh it's really unfortunate when the food is good but the customer service is lacking. We've ordered delivery 3 times in the past month alone. The first time, no rice. The second time, each entree received its own cup of rice. The third time, knowing how important that delicious basmati rice is, we call to EXPLICITLY confirm that each entree will receive its own side of rice. The person confirmed this to be true. We receive the delivery. 2 out of 3 entrees received rice, despite the conversation we had 15 minutes prior. So we call, just to ensure that they're aware of our disappointment. What do we get? Rude, curt responses that ensure that we won't be ordering from here again. If you can't deliver something so simple as rice, what else are you lacking??

The food was very good and the owners and staff were friendly and professional.  This restaurant seemed to be full of people who were genuinely enjoying themselves.

There were a few issues we encountered which are very correctable so I will mention them here with the hopes that the owners will read the reviews. The place is small and intimate which is a good thing except that as the restaurant became busy, the noise level was nearly unbearable. I believe the problem could be corrected with about 2K in sound absorbing devices or by bringing your own bottle of wine.

In this day and age with the emphasis on fresh and natural food, I was surprised when the exquisitely tasting appetizer, Manchurian cauliflower, was delivered with an abundance of FD&C Red 5.  The rationale behind the artificial color I was told, was that the dish was colorless without it. I didn't say it, but I privately noted that  minced cilantro or parsley could have corrected that. The addition of the red food dye made me question what else might have been added to the food I wanted to believe was fresh and healthy.

Went to this restau for the first time tonight, and it was a pretty mixed experience. 

PROS: 

-Were seated pretty promptly even though there were 4 of us, and the place was packed.
-Naans were very good, as were the onion kulchas
-Paneer butter masala was not bad
-Restrooms were really clean
-Noise level was not too bad 

CONS:

-Gobi Manchurian (vegetarian) was not so great
-Meat in Chicken 65 was a bit too tough 
-Chicken Chettinad was too spicy; couldn't even finish eating half of it. Have eaten this in other restaurants, including in India, and we don't think it was this hot. 
-Lamb Dhansak tasted almost like the cooked lamb was dropped into the lentils just minutes before serving 
-Rose lassi was mostly tasteless 
-To get a carafe of water while eating the spicy food, my friend had to wait awhile 

Didn't really notice the bland decor. But we were annoyed that a tip/service charge of 18% had already been added to our check. For a party of four? 

Not sure if we will come back here again, but maybe things will get better with the food as times passes.

The food was very good and the owners and staff were friendly and professional.  This restaurant seemed to be full of people who were genuinely enjoying themselves.

There were a few issues we encountered which are very correctable so I will mention them here with the hopes that the owners will read the reviews. The place is small and intimate which is a good thing except that as the restaurant became busy, the noise level was nearly unbearable. I believe the problem could be corrected with about 2K in sound absorbing devices or by bringing your own bottle of wine.

In this day and age with the emphasis on fresh and natural food, I was surprised when the exquisitely tasting appetizer, Manchurian cauliflower, was delivered with an abundance of FD&C Red 5.  The rationale behind the artificial color I was told, was that the dish was colorless without it. I didn't say it, but I privately noted that  minced cilantro or parsley could have corrected that. The addition of the red food dye made me question what else might have been added to the food I wanted to believe was fresh and healthy.

Went to this restau for the first time tonight, and it was a pretty mixed experience. 

PROS: 

-Were seated pretty promptly even though there were 4 of us, and the place was packed.
-Naans were very good, as were the onion kulchas
-Paneer butter masala was not bad
-Restrooms were really clean
-Noise level was not too bad 

CONS:

-Gobi Manchurian (vegetarian) was not so great
-Meat in Chicken 65 was a bit too tough 
-Chicken Chettinad was too spicy; couldn't even finish eating half of it. Have eaten this in other restaurants, including in India, and we don't think it was this hot. 
-Lamb Dhansak tasted almost like the cooked lamb was dropped into the lentils just minutes before serving 
-Rose lassi was mostly tasteless 
-To get a carafe of water while eating the spicy food, my friend had to wait awhile 

Didn't really notice the bland decor. But we were annoyed that a tip/service charge of 18% had already been added to our check. For a party of four? 

Not sure if we will come back here again, but maybe things will get better with the food as times passes.

Great food. Excellent size portions and service. Nicely decorated too. And always love when I don't have to separately order rice. Garlic naan was fresh. Good heat on the vindaloo. I'll be back!

This is a great addition to the resturants in this area. The food is not only authentic but also well prepared and portioned. My only qualm with this place is that the spice signs next to the food isn't very accurate- some of the spiciest tandoori chicken I've had in a while but then again, it is called the 'Spice' Room. I'd say don't eat here if you're planning on going out after and probably don't take a first date here. I left sweating from the spice. I'll definitely be going back.

First time ordering from here.  Got the Chicken Tikka Masala, the Chicken Madras and an Onion Kulcha.  The Masala is one of their most popular dishes and it was good, but not amazing.  The Madras was excellent except for the fact that I had it delivered and the container wasn't sealed properly and lost half of it in the bag.  Onion Kulcha which was good, but I thought it was a little light on the onion.  The delivery was supposed to take 45-60 minutes but ended up over 90 minutes.  I'll chalk it up to a busy night and try again some other time.

I'm glad I kept looking for this restaurant when we couldn't find it at first - they are expecting to put up a prominent sign in a couple of months to make it easier to locate. Simple, clean family-run restaurant with the best Indian food I've found in a long time and I've had Indian food in a couple of different countries. Absolutely delicious - the lamb biryani and butter chicken especially. Friendly, attentive staff. An Indian family came in to eat which is always a good sign in my book. Lost count of the number of locals who stopped in for take-out. Can't wait to go back to Chicago and introduce my husband here.

This place is great. If I could do half stars I would give it 4.5 stars. It's hard to get a perfect score from me but this place is pretty close. The food was great. The veggie samosas were some of the best I've ever had. It's also BYOB and FoodSmart is right across the street so you can grab a great bottle of wine. Service was great and very friendly as well. I hope it sticks around as I will be a frequent customer.

Amazing Indian food in downtown Chicago  This was our first time here and we got food delivered on a rainy Friday night! 
Ordered their Chili Vegetable Momos & Tandoori Jumbo Prawns. We were quite impressed with flavor & food. It was delivered within 40 mins and food was neatly packed and warm. 
Decently priced and the quantity was good. 
Two thumbs up!

In was in the Chicago downtown area seeking another Indian restaurant and found Himalayan on Yelp. Seemed like a lot of good reviews so I decided to try it. 

Environment. It is casual like a cafeteria or mall food court style seating and dine in experience. Nothing fancy. Very clean. Tables wiped down, floor is clean and the air smells fragrant of Indian spices. India music plays over the speakers. Good ambiance for the casual environment. 

Service. Immediate greeting when I walked in. Very nice staff. Friendly cashier and waiter. 

Food. Prices are moderate. $10 to $14 per meal and each meal comes w plain basmati rice. Not a bad deal. Yes. This was impressive as most Indian restaurants charge extra for rice. 

I ordered a paneer dish and a chicken dish. They arrived very hot and steaming. I asked for spice level between mild and medium.  What ranked my rating to 3 stars "average" and would stop me from returning  to eat Indian food here again is because the array of spices and flavors. The food lacked both. I was disappointed. I wanted to like it so much. It looked great. The temperature was hot. But it just didn't deliver. 

Very plain flavored Tikka Masala. No spice at all. It was like a mall food court style quick serve chicken in sauce. I really wanted to like it. And I don't like to complain. But this just didn't deliver the experience of Indian food I have been familiar with. (Check all my reviews a large % are Indian restaurants from around N. America. 

My second dish I ordered was Mattar paneer. A little better than chicken but again no spice at all. Doesn't have to be spicy. But needs the delight of spice. Seasoning. Something. The dish was loaded with onion. Which is good but I have never seen onion in Mattar paneer. 

If you want a tame Americanized version of Indian maybe you come here and ask for spicy. I'm not sure how it would be. 

For service and cleanliness very good. For spices. It lacks. It really lacks. When in Chicago, give the Indian restaurant Cumin a shot. They are located in wicker park and offer very authentic tasting dishes.

I stopped in for dinner before a class. It's conveniently located in the South Loop area.

The place is neat and clean on the inside, not super fancy but nicer than your average fast food place. If you eat in you sit at any table and they give you a menu/wait service.

I ordered the chicken curry. It came out quick, within 10 minutes. It didn't look like a large portion but after emptying the rice and the chicken out onto a separate plate, it was a good sized portion. It tasted great! I'm no expert in chicken curry, but this was a very rich and flavorful sauce with tender chicken. Rice was good as well. I asked for medium spicy and it was pretty accurate, you could definitely tell the spice was there but it wasn't overpowering.

The girl who took my order and rang me up was super nice, asked how I enjoyed everything and was a little more personable than your average quick-service restaurant like this.

The food was good, the only drawback was the price, after tax and tip this was a $16 meal. I didn't mind too much though because the food was unique, good quality and good portion size, and the service was quick enough to where I got in and out with enough time to not rush or be late to class.

Good option for Indian/Himalayan food!

This was a quick, tasty late lunch that was easy on my sensitive stomach.  I had just finished my marathon and the stomach hurt from lots of Gatorade and energy gels.  We walked in to a simple, clean environment, with friendly and helpful staff behind the counter.  I saw that they had momos, so I got them as my entree, but needed a bit more.  So a veg samosa was added.  Both were top quality and fresh, and quite soothing.  (I chose to avoid the spicy dipping sauce, and went with the masala sauce instead.  The wife got the plate with chicken tikka masala, jeera rice, a small salad, and roti.  All those also were top quality and tasty - plus a good size plate for the price.

So not much more to say.  It's simply a pleasant small place that executes its concept and menu well.

Himalayan is really a good addition to South Loop. I have been going here for quite sometime so I think it's time to give them a review.

The price and the portion are definitely worth it. And the taste is super good. You can definitely taste the spices.

My favorite is the momo (a fancy way to say dumpling!). At first, I only tried the regular momo, but when I was sick, decided to get the momo soup. And OMG, it was perfect to fight my stuffy nose.

Last week, I got their fish curry. Again, they didn't disappoint me at all. It was sooooo good. 

Delivery is faster than the grubhub estimate time so it's a plus. 

One star for taste
One star for the reasonable price
One star for the portion
One star for the cleanliness of the restaurant
And lastly one star for the delivery

Keep up the good work, Himalayan!

This is a solid addition to the neighborhood.  When I walked in, someone smiled at me and immediately handed me a menu.  Now that is what *should* happen whenever you enter a restaurant, but it often doesn't.  

There's not much in terms of atmosphere, but the place looked clean and it seemed like the servers were attending to customers quickly.  I also appreciate how secured wrapped my carry-out plate was.  They made sure that there would be no spillage and that thoughtfulness goes a long way in my book.

I ordered a "big plate," palak paneer and chicken tikka masala, with rice and a piece of roti.  With tax, that cost me $8.26, which is very reasonable.  The food was pretty good.  I am a big fan of Indian/Nepali food generally, and this did the trick.  Nothing was great, but it was enjoyable enough and filling. I would definitely come back.

This restaurant was close to the auditorium theater, so our small group decided to come here to eat. We all generally likes curry so it was a plus. We first picked here because a yelp picture showing the "menu" was a good deal.

At first I thought this place was a order first and then find a table yourself, kind of place. I was surprised when we first got here and got  we got seated. Neat-o. When we got the menu, it was not the same as the one on yelp. *2nd surprise* That needs to be updated. I forgot to take a picture of it, but I plan to come back anyways.

They separate the menu by categories such as starter, vegetarian, paneer, chicken, lamb, dessert, sides, drinks, etc (not sure if i missed one). My two other friends ordered the lamb curries. I ordered the paneer tikka masala and the roti ($2) which I really enjoyed and my other friends enjoyed theirs too.

They have two types of roti (thin and thick). I ordered the thick version since I like to dip my roti with my curry. The roti came out soft and not tough. The curry came in a small bowl and so did the rice. At first, I thought it was a good thing I ordered the roti with it, but afterwards I found that the paneer tikka masala was exactly enough to make you full. I ate all of it and left almost no curry behind. The paneer came with bell papers inside along with the paneer.

Next time when I come, I have to check up on their chicken curry! I really enjoy the food and the  staff were friendly.

A good restaurant just outside of Grant Park.
We were very hungry after Lollapalooza and this was a good find (Thanks to Yelp, of course)
We were confused if it were Indian, but yes it is. It is Indian with a bit of Nepalese flavor in it.
Lunch specials seem to be cheaper, but other than that be prepared to spend around 20$ for a good meal.
I order Chicken Makhani and it was spicy (because I wanted it that way). It was a bright red curry and I loved it. It came with a bowl of basmati rice.
Also ordered a Garlic Naan, and it was soft and smooth. Well made Indian bread and a good combo with Chicken Makhani.
My friend ordered Chicken Briyani and I hada bit of it and it was a close 5 star as well.
We went there by 9:50 pm, just 10 minutes before closing time and the people over there were friendly and accommodating and they were ok with us dining over there.
A must go if you are around the area.

Horrible Customer Service!!!! Never again... 

I was told to come to this restaurant on a recommendation from a friend.  I came showing up about eight minutes before they closed on a Sunday and as soon as I walked in the restaurant was met by a very rude woman who yelled at me "were closed" in front of all the other customers (mind you) there were people who were sitting and eating at tables I guess the restaurant was not closed for them.  I turned around and looked at the door which clearly said that they were open for another seven minutes. I pointed that out to the young lady and asked to speak to a manager... she got very upset and asked me for what reason, I pointed out that they actually did not close for another six minutes and they were people sitting eating so why was I being turned away... her answer to me was that's just the way it is we are closed...

Even after I pleaded with her letting her know that I actually drove 25 minutes into the city just to have food from Dara restaurant she still turned her nose up at me... 

You clearly riding the laurels of their good reviews on yelp... But a hunt wonder how much longer that will last if they keep treating new people like shit..

I'll never go back again and will let everyone I know about my experience and navigate them to Indian restaurants in the Chicagoland area that actually appreciate people, humanity, and customers...

Despicable!

Delicious food and friendly staff!  

I got the lamb saag (spinach) curry with the naan basket (regular, garlic, and onion naan).  You can choose from mild, medium and hot spicyness levels for the curry, and while I asked for hot it was medium at most.  Not sure if this was a mistake or if they play it safe here, but they happily brought a side of their house made chili paste so that we could spice it to taste.

Overall it was a great experience and I would recommend this restaurant, especially if you're not familiar with Indian curry.

So hard to find good Indian food that isn't just heaps of food coloring and butter!
We got the lunch special, a lot of food for 9 bucks! 
The chicken curry is home style, which means it will remind you of stuff you've eaten back home.
The butter chicken is okay, but better than the stuff available downtown so #win!
I also tried the chicken biryani and it was pretty good.
Only thing that I'd recommend passing on, is the paneer makhani. 
They didn't have the desserts on the menu, so we skipped. Next time, I will try the gulab jamun too!

I'm so glad this opened up, South Loop has a serious deficiency of Indian cuisine if you ask me. I went here just last night with some friends.

We got there at around 7:45 pm and there were at most 10 guests inside, which was positive - I don't like large crowds at restaurants.

The food was good, we got the Himalayan Special - it had everything from tandoori chicken to shrimp tikka. The prices are no good though, too expensive for Indian if you ask me.

If you're in the mood for Indian, Himalayan does not disappoint. My husband and I shared the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. Upon arriving, I thought the bowl looked small but looks can be deceiving, with the naan we found ourselves stuffed by the end of the meal. The naan was heavenly, fluffy and crisp with just the right amount of garlic. We also tried the Momo dumplings which were similar to Asian soup dumplings but without liquid, very flavorful. The chicken tikka masala had just the right amount of spice and a lovely creamy consistency. I'm definitely coming back to try out other dishes!

I got delivery from this place so I can't really comment on the physical plant of the restaurant. 

In terms of delivery it was fast and efficient. The food came hot and ready to go and the naan wasn't soggy like you can get sometimes if it hangs out in the delivery container too long or isn't fresh out of the oven. 

I've spent a fair amount of time in both India and Nepal and the food was excellent. The naan were excellent. Be warned, the portion sizes for naan are pretty big. I'm used to sad little half naan that local restaurants do. These are naan the size of a dinner plate and we ended up with a lot more than we expected.

The dal makhani was the best I've had since I was in Nepal. Very flavorful and not runny. The eggplant was similarly excellent.

When getting the lamb samosas they were HUGE. Each could have been a meal in themselves and they reminded me more of mongolian buuz than of the samosas I'm used to getting. Good marks all round there.

We also ended up getting vegetarian momo which were all around excellent. They do come with a variety of dipping sauces which I had not seen before. 

I would highly recommend this place for Indian or Nepalese takeout; they're the best I've had in a long time. Be warned that the portion sizes are substantial and you will get more food than you expected which is fine by me. We easily got three or four meals out of our order.

I ordered the chicken dumplings with the soup with an order of Samosa. Honestly the best samosa I've had in the US, perfectly flavored potatoes with a crunchy-flaky coating. As for the Soup-Dumpling combination, i wasn't much of a fan of. I thought the soup base was very thick and too strong, as the dumplings were already well-seasoned, it tasted like a Sanger+lentils soup. Otherwise it was tasty!

Himalayan restaurant recently opened this downtown location and was I excited. I am always downtown when i visit Chitown and i visit their Niles location. This last weekend, I went to see Bruno Mars and found they have new downtown location. Saved me some Lyft money instead of going to Niles. 
Well, where do i start. I was there for Momo. They have the best in Chicago. Nepali style steamed, soup and fried. Love it all. Perfectly shaped and packed with amazing flavors. 
Staffs are super friendly. This is an order at the counter and pick up the food when they call your order number kinda place. A very unique than their Niles location. They have good vibes and hip decorations.

Tried this for the first time and did delivery--really terrible. The chef made a change to the order, which I understand happens and can be the nature of delivery. But my boyfriend ordered lamb tiki masala medium spicy and I ordered malai kofta medium spicy. While my malai kofta was changed to some paneer dish (I like paneer so that was fine), but it was SO SPICY I couldn't eat it. My boyfriend likes spicy and can handle it better than I can, and even he thought it was very spicy. His lamb tiki masala, same medium spice level, but it was really mild. 

Unfortunately, I really couldn't enjoy it because it was way more spicy than requested; especially since my boyfriend's was the same spice level. 

Naan, lamb tiki masala, domo, and golab jamun were just okay. Really disappointed because it had such great reviews.

I ordered a combo with 1 entree, rice, 1 piece of roti and a salad for $6.49 and chose chicken makhani as my entree. Also got 1 samosa on the side for $1.50. The chicken was tasty but the amount served was small. The "salad" was just chopped lettuce carrots and cucumbers with no seasoning or dressing. There was lots of rice though. Samosa was very good.

Nice attractive renovated space and friendly staff.

Officially in love with Himalayan Restaurant's momos. The last time I had momo was in Northern India and resulted in food poisoning, so the fact that I've given them another shot AND crave them on a daily basis is really saying a lot. The first time I came I started off easy with the steamed chicken momo. Something about the chicken inside is soooo delicious and flavorful. Paired with a bit of sauce, it's fantastic. The next time, I decided to step up my game and opted for chicken chili momo. WOW. The red sauce scared me a little bit at first but now I'm hooked. Extremely flavorful, perfect amount of spice, and oh so good. If I lived closer, I would get these every day. Some day, if I can ever pull myself away from the momo, I'll try one of their Indian dishes.

What a find!   Some of the beat Indian I've had. Lamb Samosa were crispy on the outside but not greasy.  The lamb flavor was on point.  Chicken Korma was creamy and spicy with perfectly cooked rice. Gulab Jamin were served warm and sweet.  One complaint- no mango chutney!

One of the best South Asian/Nepalese places outside of Devon! I was surprised how good the place was since most of the previous food tenants were terrible. But every time I ran by the place, it was always packed during the week.  

  Recommendations:
* Momo soup
* Lamb Naan 
* Spinach Paneer  

My wife and I will def be back!

Wow! Where can you get a delicious lunch for $7 in the city of Chicago? Right here is where. Very much enjoyed my visit here. The staff was friendly and attentive. They give out free water as well! Had the lunch special tikka masala chicken. SO GOOD! Definitely will be back.

The waiting staff here was extremely nice! However, the vibe and feel of the restaurant was somewhere between fast food and trying to be modern. The food was a reminder of what is now found in frozen Indian food. The menu was a bit confusing with all the tikka masalas. We expected the chicken tikka masala and the paneer tikka masala to be in the same sauce, but this was not the case. One of the paneer cubes tasted sour and left a bad taste to finish off the rest. Overall, for the portion size and fast for environment this spot was too expensive.

The chicken tikka masala was very good. Meat was tender and the sauce very buttery with just the right amount of spice. The serving of rice was way out of proportion to the quite small amount of chicken. The simple salad was undressed and unneeded. The roti was very good. The samosa was unevenly heated but tasty. 

Food quality ****.  Docked * for small portion of entree.

Came here on a cold fall evening. Very cozy and inviting. The lentil soup was great  and so was the naan.  My wife had curry chicken with coconut and it was prepared very well. Will definitely return in the future and probably hit them up for carry out quite a bit.     Service was excellent.

I'm so glad this locale opened up, South Loop has a serious deficiency of Indian cuisine if you ask me. I went here just last night with some friends. We got there at around 7:45 pm and there were at most 10 guests inside, which was cool  - I don't like large crowds at restaurants anyway. The food was good, we got the Himalayan Special - it had everything from tandoori chicken to shrimp tikka. The prices were no good though, way too expensive for an Indian locale if you ask me.

Food and service both amazing!! There is a great variety of dishes. The spice level was perfect (and they were great about figuring out how spicy I wanted my food). Many vegetarian options. Restaurant was clean and everyone was so friendly. If I lived in Chicago I would eat here all the time! I had the dal makhani (hot) and my friend had the channa masala (medium) -- both delicious. Definitely recommend and definitely deserves 5 stars.

I was taking my kids for a haircut and noticed this place had just opened up. Even though I wasn't hungry, I wandered in to grab a menu. I started reading the menu and my inner-fat guy insisted I order something. Of course I ordered the biggest platter on the menu called The Himalayan Special which consists of Tandoori chicken, Chicken tikka, sheesh kabab, boti kabab and shrimp tikka. So much for not being hungry. Since I had gone this far, I ordered samosas and matter paneer because I have zero self control. Now to the review. This place has only been open for six days and I normally don't write reviews on new places because they need to get their sea legs beneath them. I am making an exception for this place. First, the two young ladies behind the counter were amazing. They gave my young son a mango shake while I perused the menu. I presume it's because he's cute. I wonder why I never get mango shakes. Oh well. Now to the food. Damn, South Loop, we finally have a great Indian restaurant. Everything in the Himalayan Special was prepared perfectly. Alot of Indian places skimp on the tandoori chicken but the pieces here were plump and delicious.  I thought I would have enough of the platter for lunch tomorrow but my sons cleared it. The wife is very critical of Indian restaurants and there have been many restaurants that I may have liked but she hated so we never go back. As she took her 1st bite of samosa, I held my breath because I loved this place. When she said this is a really good samosa, I felt good but the real test was the mattar paneer. She took one bite and the smile on her face said it all. Himalayan is my new go to spot for Indian and it's in my neighborhood which makes Fat Raju a very happy guy. Also, they have alot of Nepalese dishes that I didn't try today but the next time I go here isn't many days away.

Stumbled upon this great find while in town for business. Wasn't sure when we walked in since almost empty, but it was late on a Thursday. 
  Ordered the Lemon Rice, Veggie Korma, Chicken Saag and Lamb Naan. Everything was Great! Thick sauces, Flavorful, with correct heat (We ordered medium) and the service was top notch. Being a business owner i appreciated the fact they asked how we heard about them and then came to see what we thought of each without hovering while you ate. Overall great and we'll be back for sure...

PS: Wife loved the Bollywood music

Me and my wife visited this place while we were in Chicago. We had the best Himalayan/Nepalese food out of all Nepalese restaurants we had been to. Chicken biryani and Chicken curry is highly recommended. We also ordered Chicken Sheesh Kabab and it impressed us with a unique taste. 

Having spent almost 20 years in India, I can warrant that this place serves authentic Indian/Nepalese food.

What a great addition to the neighborhood! You will find well priced and healthy portions of deliciousness! We've been looking for a go to Indian spot and were delighted by plates we knew and some we didn't! The Chicken Momos were tasty to start, and I had the Aloo Gobi, which was spiced to perfection. My boyfriend had a massive mixed grill plate with Tandoori chicken, curried fish, Kofta, lamb, shrimp and onions. Great service and great food! You will not be disappointed! Can't wait to go back for the lunch plates.

This is a great place for vegetarians and vegans to taste a whole new world because it was just a flavor bomb every bite I took. I came here because it was near Panda Express and I am glad to say, I am happy that I walked over to try this new spot.

We ordered the chicken korma and lamb curry both spicy hot and the spice was perfect! Definitely a nose clearer level but oh so worth it. We also got the garlic naan and they were fluffy and perfectly cooked.

This was an extremely delicious and filling meal. Went on a Sunday night, no wait. Got the chicken momos to start, and what a start it was. They were the best momos I've had in the city. The curry dipping sauce was awesome. So to summarize, get the dang momos if you go here. Don't stop there, but get them first. Ordered garlic naan and Himalayan mixed grill platter as an entree. The naan was light as a feather, delicious, and a huge portion so be prepared to eat all of it because it's pretty addicting. The meat platter was full of 6 different meats: tandoori chicken, chicken tikka, lamb sheesh kabab, lamb boti kabab (which was my favorite), shrimp and fish tikka served over a bed of grilled onions. The variety of meats on one plate was great for the value and the steamy presentation made me hungrier. The mango lassi had great flavor and excellent consistency. Was there for 45 mins and got my fill and my fix. Loved this place and will be going back. 

Do not let the decor/facade fool you, this is more than just a take out haven or lunch spot.

The $4.99 lunch special was part of why we sought it out, but it was just one item that was that price. The lunch plates started at around $8 if I recall so it wasn't the deal advertised. However, worth going.

Real Nepali food outside of Nepal. Chicken momo and palak paneer are same delicious as in Kathmandu. Will definitely come back here every time I miss Himalayas.

The food is good, and for where I'm staying in the South Loop, the location is convenient. The ambience is "early Burger King." I would not eat in this restaurant - if you have the desire for their food, order it to go. Horrible service and the fast food style tables and booths are terrible. I had to get my own menu (and I suspect I didn't get the full menu) and then, every time I needed something, including the check, I had to walk back to the counter and ask for it. They weren't bad people (in fact, the manager and the servers were very nice), but they don't have the whole "service" concept down. But - the food was good. If you want the full experience, go to the Nepal House about a half mile south down Michigan. Better food and much, much better service and physical plant - for exactly the same price. Oh yeah - this place isn't cheap - think $15 entrees and at least $20/person at dinner.

What an unexpected gem in down town! We walked by after a show and the place smelled amazing so we had to try it out- the flavors are so authentic (don't have to hike it all the way to Devon!) and not too heavy or spicy (we only ordered "mild" to be safe). We'll be coming back soon for more garlic naan, veggie samosas, and palak paneer!

The best tasting Indian food in the South Loop - much better than Nepal House and Chicago Curry House.  I had the chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, chicken curry vegetable samosa garlic naan.  The chicken in the curries taste freshly made, not using leftover tandoori chicken from last night like they do at the other two restaurants I mentioned above.  The flavor and freshness rival India House.  Can't wait to try the other dishes!

So I would've given this place 5 stars, but my husband (who knows a lot more about Indian food) said he'd only give it 3, so I had to go with the average!

I ordered the paneer makhani and loved it! The portions are large and make the price worth it! The naan was also very good, but then again, I've never had bad naan! 

Also, this place is like the only place in downtown (besides TGI Friday's) that sells a frozen pina colada! Might not be a big deal for anyone but for me it was huge! I'm unapologetically obsessed with pina coladas and finally I found a place!!

My husband said he's give it 3 stars because it was just okay. He didn't particularly like his dish and was disappointed by the spices. 

So in summary, if you are an Indian food snob, maybe this place isn't for you. Otherwise, come here!! Don't let the prices shock you because the portions are huge!

Good Indian restaurant--but there's better food Indian food in Chicago.

I have been to India House several times, and I just feel like I shell out more money than I need to for the amount and quality of the food. Dinner for 2 almost always $50. They have a nice thali deal for dinner that I would recommend. I have always enjoyed their lunch buffet; though, it is also pricey. I think I like the lunch buffet more than the dinner options--maybe because I feel like I am getting more of my money's worth.

The location and atmosphere of India House is really good though. In the summer, they make it open air so it's really nice in the morning or for lunch.

After extensive menu exploration, the formula to success here is to order the Papdi Chaat, and the chicken tikka masala with Saffron rice and one of the many varieties of naan.

Upscale ambiance and pricing for an indian joint, though their food doesn't disappoint.  Great for fancy date.

The place to go for indian food if you are downtown and don't feel like making the trek to Devon.

I have had a 5 star rating dinner at this restaurant so a bit torn for giving it 3 stars.... but it represents the Lunch buffet, that's it.  

Pros-
1. Appetizers- Cocktail samosas & vegetarian tawa fry- both were mediocre. 
2. Plenty of vegetarian options- the Methi malai corn is out of this world! A dish I'm dying to recreate at home.
3. Non-veg options included Chicken tikka masala ( ahh ok), Fried fish ( I wouldn't call it 'Amritsari fish' but close), Chicken curry (redundant on the menu), and a full tandoori chicken which is served on the table (Do note, you cannot take that home) 
4. Desserts- Walnut halwa ( very rich, not too sweet, delightful), Mango icecream (which they were restocking by the time I reached and was ROCK SOLID- bummer), Gulab jamun- awful, please skip!. 


- Off the menu we got the Bhelpuri- decent but I'd not order it again. Paneer bhurji - which my face lit up hearing the name of- quite delicious, a tad bit too spicy. 

Drinks-
Brownie points, Love creative cocktails and this place incorporates home flavors- Tamarind Whiskey Sour, Cooling Calcutta etc. 

Ambiance- 
Buffet time is a bit chaotic but overall could get away with being tagged Trendy/Classy for Dinner. 

Service- 
Took a while for us to be seated. Service was ok, a bit communication gap with our server which I think this place could totally work on. 


I'd highly recommend this place for a custom meal but unfortunately not buffet.

India House Restaurant is for Nordstrom shoppers who need a break from spending $50 on socks to $77 for two vegetarian dishes, an appetizer, one order of rice (first time I ever paid for a "side of rice" at an Asian restaurant), 8 hand sized pieces of thin but well seasoned naan, and 20% tip. I'm the type of person who only allows for this type of expenditure once a year so we will not be returning. The spices were enjoyable but evaluated at a bang for buck standpoint, I should have consumed the entire spice pallet of a 15 member Indian family's buffet. My husband and I both ordered the eggplant dish which was a hearty portion. The location lacked the approachability I enjoy when I go to a restaurant in Chicago, very unfortunate as the owners seemed to have made a huge investment in creating their ambiance.

Very disappointing weekday buffet....it was a milestone b'day for my mom-in-law and we wanted to treat her, bad idea!! The vegetarian options were limited to legumes and potatoes, that shows a poor menu choice. The naan and tandoori chicken took forever to get to the table. I don't think we will be coming back anytime soon.

Yummy Indian Restaurant in River North.  I'm a big fan of their lunch buffet, which has a ton of different vegetarian and meat dishes, and then fresh naan and tandori chicken brought to your table.  As Indian buffets go, it's a solid spot! Especially with regards to convenience from work.  Also not usually too crazy that you can't get a table at lunch.

I absolutely love this place after the renovation. It was nice before but the renovation definitely upgraded it. I took my Mother here for a Mothers Day lunch (yes, I am behind on my reviews) and we had the buffet. 

Yum, yum, yum! I prefer the buffet because it offers so much and I would not be adventurous enough to try off the menu. It's not super cheap at $15.95 during the week but its reasonable considering it's all you can eat of super yummy foods and learn what you like.

The servers are professional and courteous.

The food was just ok. We ordered -
Tandoori PLatter - This was bit better than OK, it was a platter with different tandoori items. - 3.75/5
Dal- It was good -4/5
Karhai Chicken- This was bland , there was less or no spice level. 3/5

When we entered we were greeted by a teenager playing pool with her friends. As she took our order, her friends were being quite loud, swearing and being inappropriate (should have been my first clue). We ordered two dishes and three naan. The food came wrapped up to go and we sat down to eat as the teens switched the loud music on the restaurant speakers every 30 seconds. As we opened our plastic Togo bad of food and began eating the girl came back and asked for one of the items back because it was not ours and belonged to another customer. Confused we gave her the order which she then gave straight to another customer. The Tikka I orders had about 5 small pieces of shredded chicken in the greasy sauce and the same for the other beef dish. It was more of a greasy spicy soup. We packed up and went home to throw our food away. I would highly not recommend this place even for take out.

Everything about this place was good. Things were a little expensive, considering how small the portions are. But it was very tasty and the ambience was really nice. 
Of course the best way to dine is family style, so we got a little of everything. We got lamb Rogan josh, dal, buttered chicken, a fish dish, and an okra dish. And of course a basket of naan.
If you're willing to spend a little more money than usual in order to have a tasty meal, definitely check this place out. And be sure to bring friends.

I am sure the place is gorgeous at night with the chandeliers and lighting. First class!

Owning the dutches title to this place places me in the position to tell you that this place is not consistent. You can order the same dish twice and it will come out different. As happened to me with aloo tiki chat, the first time I ordered it - it was perfect and thus I ordered it again to find no chickpeas in the dish as written in the menu. The server added some bland and boiled chickpeas after I pointed it out. Food tastes good so that's a plus and the service is decent. Ambience is welcoming and set up a nice dinner mood with chandeliers, window seating and leather booth setup. But definitely pricey as expected from a downtown restaurant. And yes they have a valet parking!!

Best tandoori chicken I have had in the Midwest. Sizzling, succulent, juicy, well marinated (could taste the spices and marinade all the way in) and cooked perfectly to be really tender. 
Loved the fact that the gulab jamuns were not over the top sweet like most other places. 
Although I really liked the food, for the price, and from what I had heard from friends about this place, I was expecting a bigger buffet. 
I really liked that they have a nice big wine list on their menu, including Indian Sula wines. 

I would like to put in a recommendation to add 'chaat' items like pani puri, sev puri and/or dahi vada for at least the weekend buffet. 

Overall, great authentic Indian food right in the heart of the city! Don't need to go all the way to Devon for it!

A bit overrated Indian cuisine, but not worth the money you are spending. The ambiance is overall okay, we went on the weekend. It was a little bit over crowded. Now lets come to the most important part: the food. We went for the buffet. They have a good collection if you are a vegetarian. You will get at least 6-7 veg items. I wouldn't say the food was good. It was not tasty either. The only non veg item they had were two chicken dishes, and they were terrible in taste. But I must say they appetizers in the beginning and the sweets and mango ice cream were the best part of it. 

Tips: mix the mango ice cream and the rice curd, and thank me later. 

Notes: The checks come with a 18% service tax.

As we opened our plastic Togo bad of food and began eating the girl came back and asked for one of the items back because it was not ours and belonged to another customer. Confused we gave her the order which she then gave straight to another customer. The Tikka I orders had about 5 small pieces of shredded chicken in the greasy sauce and the same for the other beef dish. It was more of a greasy spicy soup. We packed up and went home to throw our food away. I would highly not recommend this place even for take out.

Everything about this place was good. Things were a little expensive, considering how small the portions are. But it was very tasty and the ambience was really nice. 
Of course the best way to dine is family style, so we got a little of everything. We got lamb Rogan josh, dal, buttered chicken, a fish dish, and an okra dish. And of course a basket of naan.
If you're willing to spend a little more money than usual in order to have a tasty meal, definitely check this place out. And be sure to bring friends.

Gorgeous ambience! The decor is amazing! The food for the lunch buffet is good but come early before noon. It fills up fast. The staff is very efficient and always busing and cleaning. Well oiled machine! They look professional and I love the cultural nods in the unique uniform with the elegant stitching and vibrant Indian colors! Great place to come for lunch or dinner. I am sure the place is gorgeous at night with the chandeliers and lighting. First class!

Owning the dutches title to this place places me in the position to tell you that this place is not consistent. You can order the same dish twice and it will come out different. As happened to me with aloo tiki chat, the first time I ordered it - it was perfect and thus I ordered it again to find no chickpeas in the dish as written in the menu. The server added some bland and boiled chickpeas after I pointed it out. Food tastes good so that's a plus and the service is decent. Ambience is welcoming and set up a nice dinner mood with chandeliers, window seating and leather booth setup. But definitely pricey as expected from a downtown restaurant. And yes they have a valet parking!!

Best tandoori chicken I have had in the Midwest. Sizzling, succulent, juicy, well marinated (could taste the spices and marinade all the way in) and cooked perfectly to be really tender. 
Loved the fact that the gulab jamuns were not over the top sweet like most other places. 
Although I really liked the food, for the price, and from what I had heard from friends about this place, I was expecting a bigger buffet. 
I really liked that they have a nice big wine list on their menu, including Indian Sula wines. 

I would like to put in a recommendation to add 'chaat' items like pani puri, sev puri and/or dahi vada for at least the weekend buffet. 

Overall, great authentic Indian food right in the heart of the city! Don't need to go all the way to Devon for it!

A bit overrated Indian cuisine, but not worth the money you are spending. The ambiance is overall okay, we went on the weekend. It was a little bit over crowded. Now lets come to the most important part: the food. We went for the buffet. They have a good collection if you are a vegetarian. You will get at least 6-7 veg items. I wouldn't say the food was good. It was not tasty either. The only non veg item they had were two chicken dishes, and they were terrible in taste. But I must say they appetizers in the beginning and the sweets and mango ice cream were the best part of it. 

Tips: mix the mango ice cream and the rice curd, and thank me later. 

Notes: The checks come with a 18% service tax.

This place is my "go to" when I'm in Chicago. 
I am learning/tasting that there are at least two flavor types for Masala(chicken tikki). One creamier and one more tomato ee. If your from Appleton it would be Sai Ram vs Darbar. Green Bay's Taste of India is like Sai's. Creamier. This is the way I like it. I personally choose Sai Ram and Taste of India over Darbar(still really good).
So! Just a heads up, if you are like me and you happen to be in Chicago and are hungry for Indian, this is the place. Spot on! Delicious. Great atmosphere.

Extremely overpriced Indian food, so-so quality. A solid 2.5 place but I'll round up. 

I would say it's a great spot for date night if you're willing to spend more than necessary. The garlic naan hit the nail in the head so it gets an extra star for me. We shared the baigan bharta and the chicken palak. The baigan bharta dish was different than what I was accustomed to, but I really enjoyed it but the chicken palak was way too salty for my taste. It also really bothered me that they charged extra for rice - is this common practice in Chicago? Service is fine and the ambiance is good, but I think I just really prefer the authentic, mom-pop shops when it comes to Indian.

This is a very nicely decorated restaurant with about 150 different dishes on the menu. Unfortunately the staff isn't very good, and the food is just average.

It's odd browsing through the menu, because it seems to have little organization with multiple sections devoted the similar categories, and very few of the standbys like korma, saag, and so on. 

We tried Papdi Chat as an appetizer, and the flavors were good, but it wasn't enhanced by the sturdy wafers mixed into it.

Mahi Mahi Fish Tikka was good fish, but the seasoning on the fish skin wasn't my favorite flavor.

Bhuni Gobi was extremely overcooked cauliflower; it resembled something that had been sitting on a buffet for hours.

The best dish was Channa Palak, chick peas in a garlic, onion and spinach sauce. Garlic naan bread was also okay.

The service staff seems to be mostly Russian, and wasn't strong on communication. They were out of all the juices, and couldn't produce a beer list.

There aren't many Indian restaurants in River North, but even so, I wouldn't bother to return here.

Good meal but it was an expensive meal. Four of us shared two appetizers, four entrees and two sides, we each got one beer and our check was a little over $200. Eh.

To start off our dinner, we ordered two types of samosas: 
*Chicken Kheema Samosas (2 pcs ) - Deep fried pastry cone stuffed with minced chicken.
*Lamb Kheema Samosas (2 pcs) - Deep fried pastry cone stuffed with minced lamb.

Four our entrees we shared:
*Chicken Tikka Masala - Chunks of chicken roasted in a clay oven and then folded into a cream sauce.
*Chicken Makhani - Chicken pieces roasted in a clay oven and folded in a creamy tomato sauce.
*Chicken Vindaloo - Chicken marinated in a blend of vinegar and hot pepper spices.
*Matar Paneer - Fresh Indian milk-cheese cubes prepared with green peas.
*Saffron Rice - Basmati Rice cooked with rich saffron.
*Garlic and regular Naan.
All descriptions are off of India House's menu. 

My favorite is the Chicken Vindaloo, I just love spicy things. The Chicken Makhani "butter chicken" is also an item that I would order regularly. I just need to learn how to make these things so I don't have to spend the money. haha

Our waiter was nice but very VERY hard to hear. The interior is gorgeous. Deep purples, dark wood and chandeliers all around. I would recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a place to host an event. 

Overall, the food was good, the prices..not so much. I'd like to go an try the buffett once, the prices seem better but are the food choices good? We'll see.

Found the receptionist to be completely unwelcoming both upon arrival and departure. She barely made eye contact and did not speak when seating us or when we left. The server was also unfriendly. They ruined the experience, but the food didn't help, either. I love spicy but 2 of the other 3 diners could have benefitted from a server who actually asked them about their tolerance for spicy food, as is often a practice at Indian restaurants, particularly one that is basically an overpriced tourist trap. I informed him that their mouths were on fire and he brought a yogurt of some kind to help but by then it was really too late.

The ambiance is one of the top-notch things for this restaurant. I went here on a Sunday Afternoon, and the service was impeccable for that time of the day and week. 
The dishes tasted good, but I wouldn't say the number of items in the lunch buffet were enough for a 14.95$ lunch. 
1. For starters, oh I am sorry, yeah there were no vegetarian starters. There were cocktail samosas which were their frozen counterparts fried, but not the samosas that were made in-house. The chicken tandoori served was a bit uncooked on the inside. 
2. The number of curries served for main course were good enough, but most of them were bland and not spicy like the usual Indian. 
The Rajmah Masala and the Maharani Kadhi were better than the Bhindi masala for Vegetarian. 
3. And as for the dessert, the Jamun wasn't something that wasn't good, but they were a bit less spongy than the usual and felt like uncooked ones, while the sugar syrup was way sweeter than it should be for the sweet. The Kheer was simply superb. 

All in all, the lunch was a mixture of Meh's to Okay's.
If you are looking for an Indian Fancy Restaurant, this is the place I'd recommend you to go for the ambiance!

I experienced some of the worst service of my life at this restaurant. The hostess who seated us literally looked at my partner and I with such disdain that i wondered if she was cursed with a sour face or if she was expressing her disapproval of us  being an interracial couple with two children. Upon further observation and an equal look of disdain upon our departure, unfortunately I believe it was the latter. That set the tone for an unfortunate dining experience. The food was way overpriced, extremely spicy, to the point of being inedible for me, and the waiter very inattentive. Save your money and go somewhere else...this place is most certainly a tourist trap as I can't imagine anyone dining here more than once!

Most of the dishes were bland, very oily and that's about it. The naan served on table was cold. Sweet dishes - mango kulfi n gulag Jamun were good.

Food is authentic and the use of spices is perfect. The regular Spice amount is not too spicy.

I would not say the restaurant at dinner time would be child friendly as the environment is quieter.

My friend just got back from living in India for 2 months, so I decided to take her here to celebrate her homecoming. We were being waited on by an extremely rude man, who I assumed was the manager as he was wearing different clothing than the rest of the wait staff. When I asked if we could get the India house special for 2, but substitute it with vegetarian options, he said no and gave us no suggestions or other options which I found very rude. Once we did order, we got soup to start. I ordered the tomato soup and was given Campbell's tomato soup with some chopped herbs thrown on top. We then got our food with naan that was raw in the thicker parts. The food was not horrible but also nothing I would ever crave again. All in all not a good experience. I surely will not be back.

Let's just say that the leftovers still satisfied my tastebuds the next day. 

I started out by ordering a delicious Mango Lassi - it was pure bliss. I also ordered the Papdi Chat and Malasa Papad. The Papdi Chat unfortunately did not seem to have that "sweet and sour" taste that it usually has. The taste just felt overpowered the yogurt. Oh well. However, the Malasa Papad was on point. The spices and the tomatoe/onion mix on top worked so well together.

After the appetizers, I ordered the Paneer Bhurji, Chicken Makhani, and the Vegetable Biryani. The Paneer Bhurji was delicious as fuck and devoured it the next day for dinner. It was flavorful, spicy, and much more. The Chicken Makhani was average - no real taste to it but usually, it's due to its cream base. However, I found that by mixing it's sauce with the vegetable biryani catered to the needs of my taste buds. 

In addition to the food, the service was impeccable. Our server was amazing. He was nice, genuine, and asked if he needed anything in a timely fashion. Overall, I highly recommend this place. It's costly because it's "fine dining," but definitely worth the experience!

The chicken pakoras where basically chicken nuggets with no taste and the cashew nut almond rolls were a smaller version of a Knish without the slightest hint of any cashew or almond flavor to it. Everything is a la carte (as per the waitress) so pretty much about $35 for a curry chicken dinner. The staff was nice.

This place is definitely a bang for your buck. Highly highly recommend the lunch buffet. They have a ton of options, ranging from dal, Chana masala, a couple of paneer dishes as well as the classic chicken curries. In addition, every person who orders the lunch buffet is served with their own tandoori chicken and a basket of naan on the side. A variety of desserts are also included, and I thoroughly enjoyed their gulab jamun!

Picked up dinner for a mid-week indian craving that was more or less satisfied... 
 
- Aloo tikki chat - potato was soggy, this may have been due to packaging and may be fine in restaurant.  
- Chicken tikka masala - yes i know this isn't real indian but i did it anyways... a little sweeter than i would have liked and even though i specified medium spiciness, it was very mild
- Lamb seekh kebab - well cooked but kinda bland, needed the onions/chutneys to add flavor
- Garlic naan - yum - fresh / hot / great texture
- Rice - free order of rice since it was a pick up (otherwise $5... none of the entrees come with rice which is a whole other issue i have with indian restaurants downtown)

Pricey but the portion sizes were pretty large - the order was enough for 2 people for 2 meals...

Ohh India House how you lure people with your wise selection of sumptuous curries only to fill them up with endless supply of tandoori chicken and naan. I see your devilish plans...and to top it off with delectable desserts.

I dragged my fiancee to India House earlier today because I wanted good curry. We found this gem on Yelp and fought the freezing, wind chil Chicago weather after sleeping in. 

We were quite impressed with the newly renovated decor. It was very modern with an Indian flair. We were seated in a tucked away spacioua corner of the restaurant where it was quiet and peaceful. The waiter came and filled our waters and then explained that we could start the buffet at any time and that it came with tandoori chicken and naan. 

We headed to the buffet and were greeted by the delightful aromas of Indian curries. There were at least seven different type of curries all very tasty but nut favorite being the tender goat curry.

My fiancee normally doesn't like desserts, but she thoroughly enjoyed the mango ice cream and kheer. She said she would come solely for the chicken tandoori and desserts. However, there was a small concern of the tandoori chicken being undercooked, but we weren't sure if that was because we didn't leave the chicken on the hot plate long enough.

If you're in the area and craving Indian food, this place definitely will not disappoint!

Let's just say that the leftovers still satisfied my tastebuds the next day. 

I started out by ordering a delicious Mango Lassi - it was pure bliss. I also ordered the Papdi Chat and Malasa Papad. The Papdi Chat unfortunately did not seem to have that "sweet and sour" taste that it usually has. The taste just felt overpowered the yogurt. Oh well. However, the Malasa Papad was on point. The spices and the tomatoe/onion mix on top worked so well together.

After the appetizers, I ordered the Paneer Bhurji, Chicken Makhani, and the Vegetable Biryani. The Paneer Bhurji was delicious as fuck and devoured it the next day for dinner. It was flavorful, spicy, and much more. The Chicken Makhani was average - no real taste to it but usually, it's due to its cream base. However, I found that by mixing it's sauce with the vegetable biryani catered to the needs of my taste buds. 

In addition to the food, the service was impeccable. Our server was amazing. He was nice, genuine, and asked if he needed anything in a timely fashion. Overall, I highly recommend this place. It's costly because it's "fine dining," but definitely worth the experience!

The lunch buffet is pricey (about $20 with tax and tip), especially if you don't have a huge appetite, but the dcor/ambiance and service made up for it. I loved trying a few items that I would not have thought to order off the menu as a meal, and the buffet even include dessert. The mango ice cream tasted house-made and was delicious!

With its River North location, this is an appealing place to go to with friends/guests who are visiting from out of town. The decor is very sleek and modern and it's an attractive, upscale-y setting. As such the prices reflect that and I thought it was a bit on the expensive side, but that's the neighborhood fee I suppose. 

The food was not phenomenal or worth the price, but it also wasn't an unpleasant experience. Most of the dishes were unmemorable and were standard Indian fare. The Padhua chicken was ok, and I honestly forget the other starters and apps  my table shared. 

The only dish I remember months after eating here is the paneeri naan. It was so scrumptious. If you are going to Indian House make sure you get the paneeri naan -- I could have nibbled on that the entire evening and would have been happy. 

Fine Indian food in River North but not sure I would go back.

I visited this place twice during weekdays lunch and availed buffet. Ambience was OK but food was descent. Taste or choice was just average. Given a steady flow if office going customer, they can easily focus on quality and variety and mark a notch above.  Price was way higher, given the quality and choice of lunch buffet. In suburb, when a very quality Indian buffet costs $ 14-15, here average lunch costs $ 22 if you order Lassi of any kind.

Probably one of the very few places that serve good Indian food in Chicago

I went with my team for a lunch buffet, it was everybody's first time. The buffet had a huge selection of curries - both vegetarian and non-vegetarian; they had everything from aloo matar to gobi gravy to paneer curries and chicken and mutton curries. And varying spice levels too, though not obvious from the name or tag, you will have to try the curries out. The naan was soft, fresh and nicely made. The salad and chutney options were good too. The only thing that was strikingly different was that there was no Chicken Biryani which seemed very odd. There was veggi pulao, mutton biryani and some other rice which I seem to forget :(. They had hot gulab jamun and cold ice cream abd kheer for dessert which were good too.

The place however was a little cramped up, more than you'd like. Other than that it was a very satisfying meal. We also ordered chai after the meal which was okay-ish. Just milk n tea, nothing special. Good thing though is they did not add sugar and gave us sugar sepearately.

The food was edible, that's about it. The Jaipuri Aloo was flavorless, the Kadhai Paneer was barely acceptable, and the Banjhera Daal was crap. The best part of the meal was the Masala Naan.

The music was actually decent Hindi music, and the portions were large, so there's that.

Avoid if you've ever eaten Indian food in India or NYC.

The decor is nice, well decorated, their bar is pretty. The food was excellent. Wonderful combination of spices. We started out with a small salad for appetizer, was fresh. Ordered a mango lassi to drink. They have an alcoholic mango drink on their menu I'd like to try next time. It had a nice mango garnish on it, I was jealous when I saw it on another table haha. For entree I ordered chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. My parents got the vegetarian thali. We were all very happy with our meals. The thali includes kheer which I munched on for dessert, was yummy. I would definitely come back to this restaurant. I hope they do delivery!!

Can I live in this house?

I celebrated my 29th bday here and it was just fab. I don't remember too many details, as you shouldn't on your b-day. Fast forward to this year when I spotted a deal to India House on Groupon. I immediately jumped on it and made my reso.

The decor is sleek and modern, so you know you're in River North but the smells remind you good food is up ahead. We got seated quickly and had a server help us instantly.

I love a good tikka masala or palak paneer but I wanted something more exciting this time around. I asked our server what she recommended. She said we should definitely get the malai kofta and baingan bharta. I LOVE me some malai kofta (cheese-stuffed dumplings) so I let her take the wheel and figured if I didn't like the other dish, I'd make hubby eat it :).

India House did not disappoint. Shortly after, a comp order of small breads and tikka sauce came out that was gone in 60 sec, and our entrees soon arrived with garlic naan. I am extremely picky with eggplant, but the baingan bharta was slow-roasted and immensely flavorful. It seriously hit the spot. Kofta was amazing. The sauce from the kofta was so good, I licked the bowl when no one was watching. 

The prices are a little high for Indian food, which I understand has to do with their Hubbard Street address. That rent must be cray. I will definitely recommend anyone and everyone to pass by Indian House, especially if they want to enjoy a fancier type of Indian resto on date night. Get the groupon and you'll enjoy even more. 

Now, is there room in this house for me?

The food is good but I'll never come here again, the waiter is very rude!! Steer away if you want a complete experience, I waked in he disrespected me and my guest in many ways,

1. When fist coming instead of greeting or saying hi or something, he said " you want drinks? " then I asked if he had a non alcoholic drink he answered with being annoyed " it's all there in the menu, read it and I'll come back to you"!!!!   

2. So he comes back and I ask him to explain some items on the menu he response to me " I don't know how to explain them can't you just read them"!!! So for the sake of my guest I decided to play cool ands aid to him I can but I'm asking about your most popular dishes then I ordered and I felt I'm squeezing the words out of him as if our being there is a bothersome to him.

3. I asked for water so instead of saying what you usually hear from other waiters in other restaurants yes, sure, couple minutes, he immediately turn his back and walk to a girl and pint up and down at our table and say" get them water" with attitude.

4. When he came to check on us after the food came in he said " so where are you guys originally from?" Like out of the blue! With absolutely no introduction or anything whatsoever friendly, 

I did like the food over there but it wasn't anything special over any other Indian restaurant, except the seats are clean and nice, the prices are on the higher end more expensive than other Indian places, the guy running the place is extremely rude and offensive!!

We went with the $15 lunch buffet, which included multiple veg options and only 2 chicken options (curry which was spicy and tikka masala which was more tomato based).

I am very disappointed with this place. Yesterday was my first karwachauth and we decided to eat there to finish my fast. We reached at 9:15, closing time is 10 pm . Firstly we were told kitchen will close very soon so order fast. Understandable. Food was served fast and it was tasty. What really pissed me off was that while we and atleast 10 other tables were full and eating. Our server decides to start sweeping the floor in a rush. He was not only sweeping but creating a ruckus pulling out chair throwing them back, sweeping left and right. If this was not all, he decides to answer another table with the sweeper in his hand and actually picking up a glassware from the bar and handing it over to the customers. Mind you sweeper is still in his hand. At this time me and my husband decides to call it a day and we asked him to get our check and to go boxes.  Now he picked our plates with those dirty hands and packed it for us. Needless to say the to go boxes had to see the thrash. My problem is that your food is more expensive than other indian restaurants and we are willing to pay for it for the experience we get at your restaurant. I dont think your kadhai paneer was worth 20 dollars but your ambience and service should have been. Very disappointed with this experience . Expected a lot better from this location.

What is going on with India House.  The lunch buffet has been consistently going down hill.  Been in a few times over the course of the last year and every time I think it's just an off day or fluke.  Let's give them another try and each time the disappointment continues.  My first review of this place was 5 stars 3 years ago.  What they charge for lunch vs the quality of food you get is not that good.  Food is mostly bland, no real effort it appears goes into the food or cooking. I hope management takes actions to fix this,  I'll be back later to update my review if they manage to fix the issues of food quality.

It's hard to find good Indian food in the city and I usually find myself going out to the suburbs for it. Turns out India House was better than I expected, albeit definitely more on the expensive end. 

Favorites: 
- Mango lassi - Super delicious, creamy, and tastes like real mangoes. Just a warning that my drink was slightly sour which I enjoyed because it meshed with the sweetness of the mangos.
- Onion Bahji Appetizer - Loved the three sauces it comes with, they were perfect dipping compliments to the fried vegetables.  
- Chicken Makhani - Butter chicken in a tomato based sauce. Great spices, a lot of chicken - most pieces were tender though there were a few that seemed more dry.

Skippable:
- I wasn't a fan of the garlic naan which is sad because I love garlic naan. It's a must-get for me at every Indian restaurant. This one here just wasn't fluffy :( and was rather stiff. 

The lunch buffet seems like a great option and if I were to come back, it would be for that! Dinner can add up to be way pricey!

At first, the idea of an all-you-can-eat Indian food buffet sound very enticing...after all, that's what drew me to try this place. I came here with a friend and we participated in the unlimited lunch buffet. After tax and tip, the total per person came out to be around $20. If you want to save a little money, come here anytime Monday-Thursday as the buffet is a bit cheaper during those days.

Now for the food. There was a respectable selection of Indian dishes to choose from: biryani, tikka masala, and even samosas. In addition, they had a small salad bar along with some fruit choices (only melons that did not taste very fresh) and a dessert bar. The waiters also serve you naan and tandoori chicken in addition to the food you can serve yourself at the buffet. To be honest, I didn't think the buffet food was all that good. The meat dishes in my opinion such as the tikka masala were more "worth it" than the veggie options. My plates usually consisted of tikka masala, biryani, and a couple scoops of the roasted veggies. The naan brought to the table was very fresh and was probably my favorite part of the meal. The other food tasted rather average...everything was a bit on the saltier side so be prepared to be downing multiple glasses of water after eating here. The worst part of India House was the dessert bar. They had mango sorbet, gulab jamuns, and kheer. I am not a huge fan of gulab jamuns and kheer so I opted for the sorbet; however, I found it very artificial-tasting and overall just bad.

Unfortunately, I did not find the food at India House to be to my liking. Salty, mediocre, and overpriced is how I would describe my experience.

I am very disappointed with this place. Yesterday was my first karwachauth and we decided to eat there to finish my fast. We reached at 9:15, closing time is 10 pm . Firstly we were told kitchen will close very soon so order fast. Understandable. Food was served fast and it was tasty. What really pissed me off was that while we and atleast 10 other tables were full and eating. Our server decides to start sweeping the floor in a rush. He was not only sweeping but creating a ruckus pulling out chair throwing them back, sweeping left and right. If this was not all, he decides to answer another table with the sweeper in his hand and actually picking up a glassware from the bar and handing it over to the customers. Mind you sweeper is still in his hand. At this time me and my husband decides to call it a day and we asked him to get our check and to go boxes.  Now he picked our plates with those dirty hands and packed it for us. Needless to say the to go boxes had to see the thrash. My problem is that your food is more expensive than other indian restaurants and we are willing to pay for it for the experience we get at your restaurant. I dont think your kadhai paneer was worth 20 dollars but your ambience and service should have been. Very disappointed with this experience . Expected a lot better from this location.

I really enjoy the lunch buffet at India House. The buffet has a lot of variety and is only $14.95 during the week. Outside of there lunch buffet the menu is prettt pricey so the lunch buffet is a pretty great deal. My only complaint is that their naan is not my favorite but other than that I love it!

What is going on with India House.  The lunch buffet has been consistently going down hill.  Been in a few times over the course of the last year and every time I think it's just an off day or fluke.  Let's give them another try and each time the disappointment continues.  My first review of this place was 5 stars 3 years ago.  What they charge for lunch vs the quality of food you get is not that good.  Food is mostly bland, no real effort it appears goes into the food or cooking. I hope management takes actions to fix this,  I'll be back later to update my review if they manage to fix the issues of food quality.

It's hard to find good Indian food in the city and I usually find myself going out to the suburbs for it. Turns out India House was better than I expected, albeit definitely more on the expensive end. 

Favorites: 
- Mango lassi - Super delicious, creamy, and tastes like real mangoes. Just a warning that my drink was slightly sour which I enjoyed because it meshed with the sweetness of the mangos.
- Onion Bahji Appetizer - Loved the three sauces it comes with, they were perfect dipping compliments to the fried vegetables.  
- Chicken Makhani - Butter chicken in a tomato based sauce. Great spices, a lot of chicken - most pieces were tender though there were a few that seemed more dry.

Skippable:
- I wasn't a fan of the garlic naan which is sad because I love garlic naan. It's a must-get for me at every Indian restaurant. This one here just wasn't fluffy :( and was rather stiff. 

The lunch buffet seems like a great option and if I were to come back, it would be for that! Dinner can add up to be way pricey!

At first, the idea of an all-you-can-eat Indian food buffet sound very enticing...after all, that's what drew me to try this place. I came here with a friend and we participated in the unlimited lunch buffet. After tax and tip, the total per person came out to be around $20. If you want to save a little money, come here anytime Monday-Thursday as the buffet is a bit cheaper during those days.

Now for the food. There was a respectable selection of Indian dishes to choose from: biryani, tikka masala, and even samosas. In addition, they had a small salad bar along with some fruit choices (only melons that did not taste very fresh) and a dessert bar. The waiters also serve you naan and tandoori chicken in addition to the food you can serve yourself at the buffet. To be honest, I didn't think the buffet food was all that good.

Looks like the Indian - Eastern European relations are at an all time high. Only until the 2000's have I started seeing multi-cultural staff at Indian - owned restaurants which I love. However, this combo gives you the socially awkward staff who say little and keep bumping into you when trying to fill your plate with buffet eats or you get the brute frowns and unfriendly speech of the other. Guess which is which?

Buffet: there is of course a decent variety but most of it is way overcooked: vegetables are mushy and chicken and fish are dry. The goat curry is an exception and is worth getting the buffet alone. I was really looking forward to the okra but there was far more onions and tomatoes than actual okra so that was disappointing. You will get the delicious tandoori chicken delivered to your table on a hot sizzling cast iron platter with scorched onions and lemon - LOVE IT!

The desserts are perfect - get all of them: mango ice cream, kheer and  gulab jamun. 

Mango lassi is refreshing but is $6 (and they don't put bourbon in it), so enjoy it slowly.

India house has redecorated the place very nicely but needs more fun staff to make it a better success.

Was there for lunch a few days ago. Compared to Indian buffets in NYC (where I'm from) I must say that this place was overpriced and less tasty. The only thing that really stood out taste wise was the naan - most other things were just all right. 

That being said, still a decent choice for Indian food lovers. I'm sure I'll visit again.

My friends and I were initially going to eat at another restaurant but the wait was ridiculously long. We decided to yelp another place to go for dinner and stumbled across India House Restaurant. Yelp did not fail us and the food here was delicious. 

The three of us shared the following items:
- samosas
- Chicken makhani (butter chicken)
- lamb biryani
- garlic naan
- Khumi naan (stuffed with garlic, ginger, and carrots)

While everything was really good here, I especially liked the samosas, khumi naan, and lamb biryani. 

This was by far the most fancy Indian restaurant I've been to. The servers were very friendly and helpful when we had questions about certain dishes. I'd definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for some good Indian food.

Excellent lunch buffet!  The samosas are very hot, however.  I loved the chicken tikka and the vegetable biryani.  The tandoori chicken was a little too spicy for me.  The naan, raita and tamarind chutney are excellent.  The mint chutney is medium to hot.  Excellent kheer and masala tea.   I'd go there again in a second!

We made a reservation which was a good idea. The place was packed - always a good sign. Getting right to the food, everything was wonderful. Flavorful and very nicely prepared. The naan was as good as what I've had in India. Overall, the food was outstanding!
Our waiter, however was rude and inattentive. I hope it was a bad day and not the way they do business. I'll go here again but a 3rd time will depend on the wait staff.

Ordered Pea Rice, Paneer Bhurji & Papadi Chaat. 

Pea rice wasn't really fresh. Greasy and blah.
Paneer Bhurji was very good, however. 
Papadi Chaat was abysmal. 

Having had Indian food in various cities around the world, this doesn't really qualify as Indian food. It's overpriced, underwhelming, and quite frankly, not worthy of being called Indian food.

I've heard great things about the lunch buffet, but dinner leaves much to be desired. To be clear, this is likely one of the best Indian restaurants downtown - but that, sadly, is not saying much. It will satisfy your Indian food fix if you're in a spot, but you will wake up the next morning with the same masala cravings that you had thought you had already put to bed. You'll save time (and significant money given their pricey options) by going to Devon.

Let's start with this place being over priced! But I forgot why I don't eat here until I ordered some take out yesterday! The kadhai paneer was sweet?! And the sauce in the malai kofta was watered down! The kofta to top it all was made of potatoes and no paneer! Such a disappointment! Paid $68 for samosa, two entrees with bread which did not even taste good! Never going back! I would recommend going to Cumin!

Came through because we heard good things about the buffet here and, craving Indian Food in Chicago, didn't want to pass up this time to have an extended lunch followed by an extended food coma. Greeted by delicious smells and an extensive buffet, with giant plates full of samosas, chicken and tilapia curries, and various vegetable dishes. All dishes tasted good, though disappointed there was no goat curry or chicken vindaloo. At first we were a little confused that they didn't have Chicken Tandoori or Naan, but we were presently surprised when they were delivered to our table in individual plates, piping hot. Tandoori was quite moist, and we would have asked for more if we weren't already stuffed. There was also mango ice cream, some sort of rice pudding, and these fried dough balls in a honey saffron bath that made for aa very satisfying dessert.

Good service. We had a $40 for $75 groupon that was only useful for dine-in, and when the server saw that our meal only cost $60(4 x $15/person for lunch buffet), he let us take a dish home so we could make the most of our money. So now I have dinner as well, another order of Chicken Tandoori which I'm sure will be just as delicious as the buffet.

We ordered for Chicken 65 and veggie cutlet for appetizers and a Chicken Biryani for main course. The Biryani was mind blowing! For the first time, there were no leftovers and to-go boxes ordered! The waiters and host were very patient despite we being there in the closing hours. We weren't rushed at all! The place is very beautifully decorated and maintained. However, I absolutely hated the sad boring music which is why I rate it 4 on 5.

Fairly good samosas, however an even number would have made it easier to share as appetizer. Nan smelled way better than it tasted. It was ok, nut lacked the traditional texture....more like a crisp. Chicken Madras lacked a roundness, over spiced perhaps...the coconut creaminess was missing a balance. Rice was extra, nothing special. Waiter was not always attendant, a missed order probably should've been comped. Also got the impression waiter wasn't too familiar with entire menu.

However things have clearly gone downhill in the last few years as I found from my most recent couple of visits - food is very ordinary and almost an afterthought, service has become very substandard, servers cannot communicate properly and one can see this place is cutting corners everywhere.

The food is not at all what you call Indian cuisine. Food is cold, stale and flavorless. A restaurant which can not cook a simple chicken curry can not be an authentic Indian restaurant. Just waste of money and time.You will come out of the restaurant regretting the experience. Try out some other place than this overrated and expensive so called Indian cuisine. This one is just unhealthy food.

Good tasting food in an upscale environment, with prices to match River North real estate. The dress code is casual, but every time I go in a polo I feel a bit under-dressed.  At the end of the day the price prohibits me from coming more often (they do offer deals online sometimes if you search around).

Papdi chat is a great appetizer, comes with a lot of sauce, but is the best version I've had so far in Chicago.  Chicken Makhani is solid, and be sure to order Naan or rice to use with the sauce, too good to waste any.  Lamb rogan josh in a cardamom sauce didn't impress, the flavor wasn't too strong in my opinion. Chicken madras on par with makhani, perhaps better depending on how you feel about coconut.  Naan bread is all high quality, my personal favorite is the garlic variety.  Comes in pieces but fills up a basket, lots of it but also $5.  Mango lassi was really thick, and tasted strongly of mango, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Lunch buffet was delicious, there are lots of options and everything look appealing.  Favorite dish was chicken tikka masala, followed by the mini samosas.  The buffet comes with a tandori chicken and regular naan bread.  Deserts include mango ice cream, kheer, and gulab jamun.  Worth the $17.

The service is not very satisfying although food is average. Menu is confusing I ordered Dinner special that should come with rice. However, they charged me for rice. They also charge 18% service charge on your check and still ask for gratiuty lol. If you like to eat Indian food go to Chicago Curry House. Best service Indian/Nepali restaurant.

Food is very overpriced, portions are tiny, and the service is below-par. We couldn't find our waiter for a good twenty minutes after being done with dinner. 

The lamb was very salty, the samosas were dry, and nothing really was worth the price. 

I really wanted to like this place, but it just seems to be another one of those over-priced over-hyped trendy places of Chicago that usually never meet my expectations after moving here from LA/OC.

We really really love food from here but they are just a bit pricey! We live nearby, many of the weekend we are craving some Indian food we would think about Indian house, usually we do pickup, 2 order of main food plus a garlic naan would cost us $50-60 bucks with tax and tips. Unlike other places the portion is actually smaller, you are paying what you will eat for one meal... so no leftover can be saved.  It would be great if they make the portion larger or make the price cheaper, so we would go back more often. Otherwise the $4 pre-made tikka masala sauce in a jar actually isn't bad!!

The food is not at all what you call Indian cuisine. Food is cold, stale and flavorless. A restaurant which can not cook a simple chicken curry can not be an authentic Indian restaurant. Just waste of money and time.You will come out of the restaurant regretting the experience. Try out some other place than this overrated and expensive so called Indian cuisine. This one is just unhealthy food.

I met an Indian client from Dehli and his family who are here for a couple months. The dishes were as authentic and flavorful as any in Delhi. The service was highly attentive. The desserts were traditional Indian; rice pudding, a ricotta cheese type dish, and a fried dough concoction. The Indians should leave desserts to the Germans. Only mediocre part of the meal.  The mains, nan, rice, we're all tremendous. And all without breaking the bank. I will go again.

What's not to like?  The serving staff was great!  Nice portion sizes, mehbee too much;) if that were possible....

Staff helped me through their options and what they were really good at.  Very good humor and attentiveness. Food timing and heat was perfect. 

I had their papadums - Masala Papad, fried papadum  with onion, tomato, chillies right on it.  This was an excellent twist. Best I've had in any Indian restaurant.  Full stop.  

I also had the lamb vindaloo which was hot, which I like. The lamb was excellent, tender and full of flavor.  

I also had a half dish of Palak Panner.  Again flavorful, with great texture and rich taste. May have been my favorite dish if the afore mentioned papadums didn't rock my world. 

For desert I tried their Kashmiri naan. Which is not really a desert, but I wanted to try. Nice level of sweetness to the naan, but not to much. 

Overall, I had waaayy too much food. Rolled out. Their naan was good, I didn't even get to test the rice. Also nice score for a complimentary taste of plain naan and Masala sauce. I left satisfied, I had done well!  I'd go back with my family in a heartbeat.

This place is great. We went on a Monday afternoon and the buffet is a great value for money! $14.95! Lots and lots of dishes, including starters, main courses and dessert. Alongside comes naan and a sizzler of chicken tikka included in the cost. Definitely worth it! Cheaper than even lots of places on Devon Street.

Extremely good Indian food... but really expensive. The entree combined with rice and a side of pita (which really it can't be Indian food without this) costs around 30 dollars. Definitely not a place someone can go to casually, but this is definitely the best Indian food I've ever had so far. Provided that your not on some some of budget I highly recommend this place.

I love this place! Best Indian food in Chicago - hands down! I've been for the lunch buffet several times (great way to try a bit of everything!) and I've been there for dinner several times. I typically get the garlic naan, the Papdi Chat (think Indian nachos), samosas, butter chicken, palak paneer - anything you order will be delicious! I brought a group of people with me last time that weren't too sure about Indian cuisine or had bad experiences before and now they all love it!! Love introducing people to new/good food :)

I ordered food from the restaurant before, chicken tiki and lamb curry, and it was decent. Thus, when family was in town I decided to bring them over for the lunch buffet. We arrived around 1:30pm on s weekday and very few people were there. There were around 15 "hot" dishes, all of which were luke warm. The only protein ones they had were chicken tiki, lamb stew, and fish stew. The chicken was dry and flavorless - worst tiki Ive ever had. The lamb was also bland. When I expressed my concern to our waiter he eventually agreed to have the "new chef" remake the chicken tiki. The product that come out was hot, but just as flavorless as the one on the buffet. In fact, I think they just took the exact sane ready made tiki and microwaved it. I expressed my concern to the manager who was both dismissive and rude. Im never eating here again, between the bad food, poor service and lacking professionalism I was embarrassed to have brought my family here for lunch. Ive had better Indian food at hole in the wall places for 1/3 the coat and served more professionally.

The service is excellent but quite serious. There was only one waiter who smiled. I had the India House Meal and it was delicious overall. The dahl was a bit bland, not great texture, no perfume but the grilled tandori chicken, lamb kabobs and fish (mahi) were awesome! The servings are generous. The meal for one was more than enough for two. I would order the two person one for four, really! And I like to eat, trust me. Wasn't the best nan I've ever had but bad nan is impossible right?
The rice pudding was also delicious. Nice atmosphere too.

Raising to 3-stars due to a much improved experience a couple of weeks ago. Since Kim invited me back to dine, I took my friend to the Sunday buffet. This was actually a much better deal than their regular menu. In addition to the buffet selection, the servers bring out naan and a chicken dish. Since I'm vegetarian, they switched out the chicken for tandoori vegetables. Aside from the buffet being a good value ($17.95/pp on weekends), the service was much better which was my primary concern about returning. I'd expect better service during "a la carte" hours versus during the buffet, but I won't complain because it was a decent experience and our waiter was very thoughtful. Nothing particularly blew me away this time around, but I'd now consider returning again for the buffet (still won't go back during the other times due to my prior negative experiences). 

--------

I just spoke with Kim and I will say I'm impressed with her response. It's nice to know that customer concerns are taken seriously and that they are making a concerted effort to prevent experiences like these from happening again. Kim invited me in to dine again and if the experience is more positive, then I will definitely consider raising my initial rating since the food itself is pretty tasty. Giving an extra star now just for Kim's kindness and genuine interest in knowing the details of what happened last week. 

---------

Never again. The service at this restaurant is absolutely abysmal. It's unfortunate because the food itself is actually not bad and offers several options for vegetarians, but I will never keep patronizing a place where the waiters are condescending and curt. 

The only reason I decided to try this place again after the first experience where we waited *1.5 hours* for two entrees is because they were offering 1,000 point tables on OpenTable and we wanted Indian cuisine. We arrived to the restaurant 1 minute after our scheduled 6pm reservation time and found out that the restaurant moved us to the 6:15pm slot which only was worth 100 points. Honestly, this was the least concerning subpar service we received. 

My friend and I came here after a busy day of work and weren't both super hungry. Given that I had been here before and was aware of the portion sizes, I suggested we split the vegetarian tasting platter and an appetizer along with some drinks. When we went to order this, the waiter told us that each entree is meant for one person, but we told him the amount of food we ordered would be well suited to our appetites. He rudely snatched away the menus to the point of giving me a paper cut from the loose page and briskly walked away. My friend and I just looked wide-eyed at each other like, "Whaaaaat did we just walk into?!" 

When the waiter appeared again 10 minutes later, we reminded him that the dish we ordered came with soup or salad but we forgot to state our preference earlier. After asking for the salad, he snapped, "It's already coming with salad," and again walked away without any care to our experience. 

Not to mention that the rest of our service was awful since our meal came out before the appetizers and no care was given with regard to a few other minor details. It even got to the point where we were asking the waitress working other tables for water, etc., because we didn't want to deal with our waiter's attitude on what was supposed to be a nice night out.

Oh, the bill still came to $28/person even though we split one appetizer, one veggie platter, and non-alcoholic drinks. I'm not sure what all his fuss was about for not ordering separate entrees. That's still not what I call "cheap."

We went back for the lunch buffet on June 28th and WOW what an amazing deal! The buffet includes fresh tandoori chicken and naan for all of your guests, soup, and an array of vegetarian, chicken, lamb, fish dishes, and even dessert (the mango ice cream is phenomenal). Even some of our guests who were not familiar with Indian food loved it. Highly, highly recommend.

Terrible service. I ordered online and waited over 2 hours to get the food. I called the restaurant multiple times and whoever answered the call had me on hold for few minutes only to cut the line. The rare times this person (always the same one) chose to speak, it was usually one line "order is on the way only 10 minutes". The food delivery guy said he only received the items "10 minutes" ago when he showed up. 

So not worth waiting 2 hours, food was oily, i drenched 3 tissues to get it all out, still couldn't eat it. Never again to this "10 minutes" food place. If only i can trade the one star on yelp i'm obligated to give for all the minutes i had to spend dealing with this place.

Came here with the hopes that this was going to be good from the Yelp review, but contrary to my expectations. Ordered goat biryani. A $22 dish and only received 3 pieces of meat and a whole ton of rice. When mentioned, they provided a side goat curry dish that came out in 2 minutes and it was the most heinous tasting dish. 

For a person who knows their Indian foods, this was not a treat. I am giving a 2 because of the waitress. It's never their fault.

Excellent good, inconsistent service. 

I have been to India House three times: once for lunch, twice for dinner.  Everything you hear about their food is true.  It is one of the best Indian Restaurants south of  Devon in terms of quality food.  The curries are amazing (check out the delicious saag paneer) as are the biryanis.  They have wonderful apps, and the naan is on point. 

However, I have noticed that their service is off sometimes.  I received excellent service at lunch and the first dinner, but the last time was unexpectedly poor.  I am not sure if they were understaffed that night (a Tuesday around 6pm), and it was not very busy.  It was a struggle to have our water refilled.  It took nearly 20 minutes for the server to take our order even though it was a nearly empty restaurant, and the service was very intermittent.  

I must say that service has been totally fine every other time I have been here, but I would hesitate to bring a large party here.

Came here for the buffet lunch. They had a decent assortment of indian delicacies. Aloo Tikki, Butter Chicken, Fish Curry etc. Definitely interesting was the saag dish with mushroom. 

As standard fare, they brought tandoori chicken at the table and also fresh naan.

This is perhaps one of the classier indian restaurants, great locations and they have made an effort to spruce up the interiors.

Very good lunch buffets but they don't offer lamb curry which is a little disappointing. However, the many choices, dessert offerings and service make up for lack of lamb. Highly recommend if you're near the River North are and you are craving Indian food.

I came here for dinner with one of my good friends to hang out and catch up. I was able to make a reservation on OpenTable pretty easily, and that was nice to have a table ready at our preferred time. When I first saw the menu however, I was a little flabbergasted when I saw the prices. $20 for a vegetarian entree? That's pretty pricey, so the food better be INCREDIBLE. Unfortunately the food was just alright. I ordered the matar paneer, and I felt it needed a tad bit extra salt, more red pepper and spicing, and a good tablespoon or two of lemon juice. They also don't offer 1 naan or rice with the entree, you have to spend an extra $5 to get that. I will say that I've never been to a restaurant where they didn't provide you with a naan or rice when the price of the entree was greater than $18. Overall, I give this a "Methinks not" and 1 star, because I most likely will never be coming back. Why? Food was alright, price was twice as much as it should have been for the quality, and they cheap out on giving the customers naan or rice. By hoping to maximize their profits by doing this, they take away from the customer experience and leave a bad taste (pun intended) in the mouths of the guests.

I'm an South Indian, and visited this place with family and friends. The ambience of the please reminded me of restaurants in metropolitan cities in India. So did the staff, who I felt were grumpy!
But do I recommend this please? Yes. 
We ordered some chaat and tried their South and North Indian thaalis. The chaat was good, but not great, but the thaalis involved some very refined and upscale Indian cooking. Will definitely revisit this place to try more of their dishes.

Cumin is a fine restaurant with delightful experience offered to all who step inside. The spices are flowing throughout the air and the aromas transport one to Nepal or India or both. 

With a large menu that is including many vegetarian and meat centered dishes, the hints of cumin, turmeric, clove, anise, garlic, curries and more will delight your every sense. The nose will guide your way to the dish your heart desires. As a visitor to Chicago, I went out of my way to locate and visit Cumin. I am pleased I did.  Service was friendly and accommodating.  Full bar is offered with beer and wine and liquor. The environment is casual but there is room for a larger group as well. This would be a fine choice for solo diner. Date. Business or family meal.  

Palak paneer over basmati rice and onion kulcha on side is below.

Went here about a week ago for dinner on a Saturday night. Other than slow service, place was amazing. 

Came in on a Saturday evening about 6:30 and the place was surprisingly empty (maybe 6-7 other tables). After waiting a few minutes, ordered the butter chicken, basmati rice, and the naan. All of the above were great...flavorful and plentiful. The quantity was great and the heat could have been a little more, but nothing to really complain about. 

Great atmosphere and is obviously in the heart of Wicker Park and all the hustle a d bustle and of people watching to enjoy.

Indian food is one of my favorite types of cuisines so I am always in search of delicious Indian food in the West part of Chicago since Devon is a hike.  I've been to Cumin a few times and it's never disappointing.  I like that there is a lot of space here and it has a romantic, intimate ambience.  The service is decent and they are great with the water refills.  I felt a little rushed when they were taking plates away but the overall service was decent.  I would have liked if they asked us what level of spice we wanted since we both like spicy food and our meal could have been spicier.  

I appreciated that they give you a complementary order of poppadom (crispy, fried lentil wafers) served with a mint and tamarind chutney.  It was crispy and plentiful!  We started with an order of the Samosa Chaat and it was very delicious!  Basically, the chaat part consisted of boiled chickpeas a little raita, tamarind-mint chutney served over crispy, flavorful samosas.  It was a rainbow of colors and flavors!

For our entrees, we ordered the Palak Paneer and Baingan Bartha with a side of basmati rice and garlic naan.  Their portions were generous and filling.  The palak paneer was tasty, had thick spinach and paneer, and a great texture.  I would have liked for the sauce to be more flavorful/spicy but this tasted good overall.  It was a creamier version of palak paneer than what's served at some other Indian restaurants in the area.  

The Baingan Bartha was my favorite.  It was minced, roasted eggplant with tomatoes, onions, ginger, and a creamy but not thick sauce.  The eggplant tasted fresh and the ginger complemented the eggplant flavor very well.  The spices were blended perfectly with the vegetables making it a medium-spicy flavored dish.  

The garlic naan and rice were good.  I would have liked if the naan had more garlic but that's just my preference because I love garlic.  Overall, this was a great dining experience and I look forward to the next time I am here and trying their other dishes.

I had really high hopes for cumin and being told it was some of the best Indian food in Chicago. I will say the food itself wasn't bad by any means; in fact, everything I tried was pretty legit. But it was nothing that blew me away and the experience we had trying to get the order and the bill taken care of almost made it tough to justify. 

Despite the staff being friendly and fairly attentive, the food came out incredibly slowly and it was a struggle helping our friend with food allergies find a meal that worked for him. After having to switch his meal up post miscommunication with the waiter, he was still charged for both and both were brought out to be served. In the end it was all resolved, but it was a tedious process to do so. 

The garlic naan was great, and the chicken tikka masala was also pretty solid. Everyone enjoyed heir meals, but for the length of time it took for our food to come out on top of the confusion with the bill, I'm not sure I'm dying to return. I would definitely recommend giving it a shot if you're craving Indian and in the wicker area, the food is pretty good; just be prepared to be there for an extended period of time since no one seems to be moving with a sense of much urgency here.

I would definitely give this place five stars if they had a draft beer. 

The food and service certainly deserve five stars. I have been here a few times and the food was always absolutely amazing and pricing very reasonable. They have so many amazing vegetarian options that I always struggle with what to order. Their buffet it's also amazing and only $15 per person. However, vegetarians have much more to choose from than meat eaters, but then again - unlimited delicious and healthy food for only $15? Definitely worth it! At their buffet, they also have bunch of fresh veggies and two different dessert options if you manage to save some space when eating all their delicious food. 

This place is really good for coming with a group or children. 

Outstanding customer service!

Kicking myself for not coming here sooner. We ordered a bunch of vegetarian dishes, samosa, and tandoori chicken. Note: when they ask how many pieces of chicken you want, they mean huge chunks - it was a lot of chicken!

Anyway, the food was delicious; the only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because their service was pretty slow, and this super obnoxious ring tone kept going off - like, for at least three minutes nonstop at one point. It was supremely annoying. Oh well. 

Definitely try Cumin (for the food) ASAP!!

Growing up eating Indian food  I feel this is the closest thing to home cooked Indian food in the area. Amazing flavors and spice and def recommend the paneer dishes. The prices a bit much for the area but location is great with plenty of seating. They do take reservations and have a full bar selection. As with most Asian restaurants the wait staff is a bit slower and not as attentive or a bit pushy at times. But the food def makes up for it and a must go.

As far as I'm concerned all Indian food is good food - it's kind of hard to go wrong with Indian food. So this place had to be good, right? It was :)

Had the lunch buffet. The selection was standard, the quality was expected and the price was reasonable.

This place has the best Indian food I've ever had. Im not Indian, nor do I claim to be an expert on Indian food, but I have been to numerous places serving it and no where has been as delicious as here.

The chicken jalfrezi is my go to entree. The chicken is so juicy, veggies are cooked perfectly, and the sauce is incredibly spiced. 

Hands down love this place. Just make a reservation on weekends - its normally packed.

Definitely a staple for Indian food in Chicago. Their dishes are always quality and flavors always well developed and deeper than most. Their spices come together for some of the greatest blends i've probably ever had, even better than a lot of the restaurants i've gone to on Devon St. up north.

I will say that Cumin does tend to get busier and their service does suffer quite a bit sometimes, however. But that doesn't mean that their food is any less fantastic. I absolutely love this place and would come here any day of the week.

Came here early on a Sunday before the Chris Rock show, we were binging on burgers and fried food all weekend and wanted something that would make us feel less disgusted with ourselves.  First the establishment is cute, seems to seat a decent about of people, from the other reviewers, you may want to make a reservation though.  We did not, but we also came in at like 6 on a Sunday and waited to be seated for a bit.  Was able to look over the table and see their reservation book pretty busy for a Sunday evening.  We started out with the Chaat...okay I did not like this, should have stuck with the regular samosas and rate that dish like a 2.5 stars because i didn't like how it was constructed.  They basically took a samosa that wasn't even warm, threw some chickpeas and cold yogurt on it and served it.  This could be my fault for not reading it, but for some reason I felt like it should have been warmer and some of the items should have been cooked in it.  The room temp or even cold temp of yogurt mixed with the samosa was a turn off. 

Onto the entrees, this is where the meal redeems itself.  We ordered chicken tikka masala and an avaratan korma along with some garlic naan and basmati rice.   Everything was delicious, especially the garlic naan that comes out warm and just melts in your mouth.  Both dishes were really tasty with the right spices.  Only thing we should have done differently was asked for it a bit spicier.  I never know how spicy to ask for it sometimes because I've had times where it's too darn spicy where your taste buds stop working into the second bite and you're left eating without actually tasting your food.  I now know for next time how much heat to ask for.

We didn't leave a speck of food left and ate everything. Everyone was super nice, but it did take a bit of time to get our check after we were finished, but other than that and the disappointing appetizer (which I can totally overlook) this place is great!

I just recently moved to Chicago and I was so excited to see there were so many Nepali restaurants in the area, Cumin is hands down one of the best Indian places I've been to, I'm giving it 4 stars only because of their lack of Nepalese items on the menu. They only have about 3 Nepali items (momo, chwela, and Nepali style chicken) and everything else is Indian. I was a bit disappointed when I saw the menu but after I tried the food my taste buds definitely helped me get over that disappointment! I'm Nepali myself, and I swear that no one makes momo better than my mom but Cumin was so damn close, omg their chicken momo was so juicy and flavorful, the achar (dipping sauce) was just like nepal.. pure momo heaven! This is the first Indian place I've been to that doesn't serve their dishes with rice so we got the Kashmiri pulao, i highly recommend it! The basmati rice was on point and the peas, cashews, and raisins blended so well together. For those who don't like the heavy cream in the tikka masala, try the Nepali style bone in chicken.. it tasted just like home, the spices worked so well together and the meat was so tender! I'm going to ordering a lot of take out from here, keep up the good work guys!

Visited this spot on a Tuesday night for dinner with friends. Overall, I recommend the spot and would return.

Atmosphere: Casual, the place was not very busy so we were seated after a few minutes. A good spot for groups as well.

Service: It did take a while to get seated because they seemed to have an issue with their generator but I assume that's an anomaly. Their system was down so the waiter had us wait a bit before we ordered. Regardless, after the ordeal was sorted out our server was very friendly.

Food: As you will see in other reviews it is a little pricey for Indian food but won't break the wallet. Entrees ranged from $15-$20 but dishes like the biryani are large (enough for two). We ordered the lam biryani, the chicken tikka masala, basmati rice, the chicken in tandoor, and garlic naan. Overall very delicious. The biryani was great and flavorful. I will say my chicken tikka was not amazing and I'd probably order biryani next time. The naan was delicious! Definitely good portions for sharing.

Bottom line: I will be back, the food was good as was the service.

LOVED IT! Only docked a star because I try to give 5 only to places that blow me away but this was awesome. Fiance had chicken vindalu and I had chicken saag (I subbed their dark meat for white meat for $1 more - not on menu but they were willing when I asked!), plus garlic naan. No rice. Thank goodness we didn't have rice because we were stuffed with all that! This is not a quick place - the food took some time BUT I don't fault them whatsoever for that because it tasted made to ord r and was piping hot when delivered. The service was pretty good other than food taking a bit. The bathrooms were fine - I appreciated that there were four TP rolls to choose from in my stall lol. Lots of people were drinking a yellowish iced drink - perhaps a tea or smoothie? We just had water, but the wine list looked good too. With tax and tip, $47 for two full meals. I will definitely go back! This was some of my fave saag in town.

My boyfriend and I love Indian food! Living in the west loop our options are somewhat limited. It's nice to have places like Cumin that is somewhat close to home. We came in last Friday (9/30) right around the dinner hour. We didn't have a reservation and they weren't busy at the time we arrived, we were seated immediately. Upon sitting down we were greeted by our waiter who also brought us waters. 

We started the night with an order of the Vegetable Samosas which comes with two pieces. As for Entrees my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala - Plain Rice - and an order of the Garlic Naan, I went with the Chana Masala and Plain Rice. 

My boyfriend loved his dish, it's one of his favorites! The Garlic Naan was flavorful and his Chicken Tikka Masala hit all the right marks, and the level of spice was perfect! My dish was really great too and packed full of flavor! I love eating my Samosas as I eat my Entree, I just love mixing those flavors! The Vegetable Samosas are generously packed full of ingredients that go perfect with just about anything on their menu, you really can't go wrong with them!

Everything was great, the atmosphere, the food, the service, we couldn't have asked for more that evening. I do have only one complaint and unfortunately every time I've ordered I like to order my meals EXTRA SPICY, I often emphasize on the EXTRA, and my meals often come out as the standard level of spice with no spice adjustment. Maybe it's me, maybe they don't go 'Devon level of Extra Spicy'? I want that spice that will make me sweat!!! Regardless if they get my level of Spice Expectation right, I always love and enjoy my meal! I love Indian food!

I definitely recommend checking this place out! If you are looking to be slapped with flavor and leave stuffed, this is the place to be! Perfectly located if you are living in the city, no need to make a trip out to Devon! Cumin is perfect for a date, dinner with friends, whatever! Service is always nice, it can get a little loud in there which often makes it hard to understand the staff. Nevertheless, check this place out if you haven't and see why people like me keep coming back!

Cumin claims to be Nepalese, but honestly the menu seemed pretty much Indian other than the different spelling of the dishes. The music was surprisingly Top 40 hits, or something of the sort. The ambience is fine, nothing special, but definitely clean. Also, the prices ain't cheap for Indian food, even for NYC standards.

The korma was yum, so was the saag paneer. The goat was on point, and on bone. I've had spicier vindaluu, but still solid. The lentils were surprisingly great -- this is a huge win for Team Vegetarian. Unfortunately, my friend's chicken tikka masala was laughably bad. A bland, orange/red soup.

To be honest, it may just be that I have yet to explore Chicago's Indian food scene, but I can see myself coming back, especially if I'm in the neighborhood.

The food was good, not great. Beyond that, the prices were on the high side, although not high enough to be egregious. The worst part, and the reason I will likely not return, is that our waiter completely forgot our order. After 45 minutes of waiting, I asked where our food was. Instead of confess that he had forgotten to put it in he made up an excuse and then proceeded to bring out the food 15 minutes later. We were not given so much as an apology, much less any discount on the meal.

Solid Indian food in pretty decent portions. On a Friday night, the place wasn't too packed and we were seated without a reservation. Between the two of us, we shared the Lamb Biryani, Chicken Makhani and some garlic naan. Simmered in rich tomato sauce, the chicken is tender, and the lamb biryani is stuffed with spice-marinated bone-in goat meat. The food is as tasty as many good Indian places I have been to, although it is on the pricier side. Service was quite slow but not that big of a deal if you are not in a hurry.

Just ordered this for delivery and I'd say it's a solid 3.5 stars. I am Indian and think the food is pretty good- the chicken tikka is average but the palak paneer was really delicious. It's hard to be consistent when you have options from too many different parts of India/Nepal- but they do everything on the menu reasonably well. One thing I have to mention is that the food is way over priced ie $14 for a vegetarian entree that doesn't include rice?? Obnoxious.

Started off bad by a server who acted like we were bothering him for coming in. The plates appeared dirty as well.  Once seated, we got a mango lassi which was absolutely phenomenal. Probably the best I've ever had.

The plain naan was spot on. Chewy and has the right amount of crunch on the bottom. 

The entrees were disappointing. Runny and flavor lacking. Indian is supposed to be about flavor euphoria and Cumin definitely missed the mark. 

Chicken Tikka Masala (spicy) was flavor lacking and runny. The Palak Paneer was decent, but still lacking quite a bit in terms of seasonings.

Unfortunately not coming back. At $15 am entree, I expected lots more.

Of all the Indian food in the city, Cumin serves some of the best I've ever had. The samosas are huge and baked perfectly. All the vegetarian entrees I've had have been delicious. Beautiful atmosphere as well. Highly recommended!

I had the lunch buffet for $15 and was very disappointed. The food lacked flavor. A plus for having plenty of vegetarian options. Unfortunately, they did not have samosas on the buffet menu.

Come for the food , NOT THE SERVICE!  As a Wicker Park local, I walk by this place almost daily. The aroma outside of the place is just heavenly and so on a chili Saturday night my girlfriend and I finally decided to try it out. The place was pretty empty when we walked in, we were greeted by a waiter who asked if we had reservations, we told him no and he told us it would be a few minutes. We were a bit put off by this as more than half of the tables in this small restaurant were empty. After being told to awkwardly stand near the "bar" we were seated after about 10 minutes in a 4 top table that only had three chairs. We sat at our table for at least 15 minutes before our waiter showed up with waters. Service was awful and there seemed to be zero sense of urgency from the wait staff. We considered leaving since it seemed no one was interested in our business. We finally ordered and were astonished that the $17 chicken tikka tandoori did not come with rice! Rice and naan were separate $3.50 each! The only saving grace was the food, it was delicious, but not worth it's price or suffering through horrible service.

Zagat AND Michelin rated? 

I took my Indian food obsession to this Indian & Nepalese space in Logan Square to see if the fluffy tire man was right. The restaurant boasts a trendy bar, traditional with a smidge of contemporary decor.

 My friend and I got the buffet, which was like a Sophie's choice since stuff on the actual menu exceeded the $15 all-you-can-eat fare.

The fact that the buffet separated everything that was vegan and vegetarian away from the main dishes is something I heavily appreciate, having food restrictions myself. 

TIKKA MASALA/PALAK PANEER: You could pair this sauce with chicken, tofu, or sedimentary rocks. I felt like I was embarking on the nine fold path, or ascending from the waves like Venus herself. 

CURRY VEGETABLES/CHANA MASALA: Outlaw this dish honestly. 

So come here if you want to take your tastebuds on a journey, throw away the menu, get the buffet.

I am shocked this is on the Michelin Bib Gourmand list. It must be for the lunch buffet. I went for dinner during the week and it was quite busy. Service was terrible..not because they didn't try, but because none of them seemed to have any clue what they were doing. Very strange. They nearly refused to give us a 2nd round of drinks while we waited a long time for food. Server hit me in my boob when he took the plate away and dropped a fork on my foot. Lol it was comical.
And the thing is..the food was just ok. Definitely near the bottom of the range of all the indian food I've ever had. We had a lamb something and mattar paneer. The lamb was lean - not as tender as I would expect. And the Naan was not great! Usually naan is my favorite part. I would try the buffet if it was convenient but not rushing back.

Fantastic little spot for some quality Indian food! It's a great place for a group or a date night. The veggie samosa was amazing, and I'd highly recommend the chicken madras or masala. You can't go wrong with the garlic naan either. Each of us in the group ordered something different so we could share, and there was plenty to go around. Looking forward to going back and inviting new people along to experience Cumin!

Best Indian food I've had in Chicago. You are getting quality food when you come here. I have come for lunch buffet and dinner and they are equal quality. Chicken tikka masala is my favorite from here as well as the chili chicken. A little pricey but worth it!

Solid Indian food in pretty decent portions. On a Friday night, the place wasn't too packed and we were seated without a reservation. Between the two of us, we shared the Lamb Biryani, Chicken Makhani and some garlic naan. Simmered in rich tomato sauce, the chicken is tender, and the lamb biryani is stuffed with spice-marinated bone-in goat meat. The food is as tasty as many good Indian places I have been to, although it is on the pricier side. Service was quite slow but not that big of a deal if you are not in a hurry.

Just ordered this for delivery and I'd say it's a solid 3.5 stars. I am Indian and think the food is pretty good- the chicken tikka is average but the palak paneer was really delicious. It's hard to be consistent when you have options from too many different parts of India/Nepal- but they do everything on the menu reasonably well. One thing I have to mention is that the food is way over priced ie $14 for a vegetarian entree that doesn't include rice?? Obnoxious.

Started off bad by a server who acted like we were bothering him for coming in. The plates appeared dirty as well.  Once seated, we got a mango lassi which was absolutely phenomenal. Probably the best I've ever had.

The plain naan was spot on. Chewy and has the right amount of crunch on the bottom. 

The entrees were disappointing. Runny and flavor lacking. Indian is supposed to be about flavor euphoria and Cumin definitely missed the mark. 

Chicken Tikka Masala (spicy) was flavor lacking and runny. The Palak Paneer was decent, but still lacking quite a bit in terms of seasonings.

Unfortunately not coming back. At $15 am entree, I expected lots more.

This place seems to have gone downhill since it opened years ago.  The first time I went with a large group I had a great experience and great food. As recently as late 2015, I still had a good experience, but I went yesterday for dinner on a Saturday night, and the experience wasn't that great.

I don't know if they've Americanized their Indian food, but all the food was very bland and not flavorful.  The appetizer was fine, but a little bland.  I didn't think anything bad, but when we got our three main dishes, all of them were not very good.  Very bland and not a lot of flavor.  I don't know what happened to the food.  We ordered three different naans.  They were hot and good though.  No problem there.

Also, the service wasn't that great.  Took a while to take our order and get our food.  After we got our appetizer and finished, no one came by to clear the table for a long time.  Finally after waiting a long time for the main dishes, I asked someone to clear the table.  A minor issue, but a sign of bad service.

Maybe a just bad experience or maybe a sign of a restaurant going downhill...

Prior to my relocation to Asia, I HATED Indian food. Once I touched down in Korea, I LOVED it. So, three years later, when it's time for me to return to America, I'm definitely thinking about where will I get my Indian/Nepalese food fix. Yelp-ers were generous with the reviews on this place, so I decided to try it with my cousin. 

We ordered my favorite, Paneer Mahkani along with Butter Chicken, shared plain naan, basmati rice and chicken pakora and I had a mango lassi for dessert. Honestly, I'm not going to run down each item. I'm just not going to because I'd be saying the same thing over and over and over. This food was SO GOOD! Like, it was all AWESOME. Furthermore, they have tamarind sauce. I have NEVER seen tamarind sauce at Indian Restaurants here, so that was a huge plus. The Mango Lassi was definitely the best I've ever had...PERIOD. All of that food was 56 dollars before tip was is pretty reasonable. 

I see why folks say this place is slight on the expensive side and ordinarily, I would agree. However, this isn't a down home styled spot. It's pretty nice. I'd be happy if this was chosen for date night.

The food is pretty good.  Only problem is that it is waaaay overpriced.   I mean for the amount of food you get, once you add the hefty price they charge for rice and bread, you end up paying a lot for dinner.    I would go here more often and give a higher rating if it wasn't so pricey.   Why is plain white rice so expensive??  I don't follow these things, maybe there is a rice shortage.

Staff was nice.

I came here with a friend early on a Monday evening, and there was nobody else in the restaurant. The food was decent in terms of flavor, but I felt that the portions were small for the price. My friend and I didn't enjoy the service; we both felt rushed and unwelcome. At one point, I was eating the complementary chips, and the busboy was in such a rush that he grabbed a plate out from under me as I was still using it.

Honest review: make a reservation because it does get crowded. The portions are small n they dont put alot of meat in the entrees so id recommend ordering alot of food. There isnt alot of meat so u end up with alot of sauce the nan is good but not enough so u end up with alot of sauce id recommend either getting the unique rice that they have or if u wanna save money just eat the meat n take home the sauce n u could eat it at home. The best things were chicken madaras, the chicken masala, n the goat choela
The service was really good it was really busy n he still was very attentive. The ambiance is really pretty really nice inside kinda small though. I wanted to order desserts but they dont have anything that sounded good they sounded to plain they should fix that n put more meat! Plz comin back again

Lamb samosa: the lamb was really flavorful. You could taste all the spice in it so it wasn't bland. The lamb was tender nothing lacking in the lamb. The actual crust of the samosa was a little to hard but still good. What I disliked is there was no sauce. Anything fried needs a dipping sauce. I used the two sauced that u get with the chips it comes with greenery but plz dress it put something on it don't jus give me random greens that's a waste

Goat chhoela: this was really flavorful the lamb was nice and tender had a lot of delicious spices on it there was a lot of goat in this appetizer so it is filling. It comes with this crunchy side idk what it was but it added a nice needed crunch to the dish it really made the dish perfect I wish all the entrees had this crunchy stuff for some added texture. After u finish eating the goat and all that's left is the greenery u mix it with the leftover sauce n throw in all the crunchy stuff amaaizin! 

Garlic nan: not ur store bought nan that is to thick its more like a flatbread. Its light and fluffy picture like thin crust pizza without cheese. If u dont like garlic dont get this its very heavy on the garlic picture like a really light garlic bread thats what it tastes like its really flavorful just be warned not alot come in an order so if u have alot of entrees ur shit out of luck

Chicken madras: the chicken was so tender it just melted in ur mouth. The actual chicken was really flavorful i could not stop eating. The only issue there isnt a lot of chicken like after a couple of bites ur left with a bunch of sauce. The sauce was phenomenal so much flavor. Its spicy but the coconut cuts down the richness and spicy ness it makes it perfect like i cant wait to come bakc to eat this again 

Chicken tikka masala: omg so delicous!!! This was so flavorful so much depth of flavor. The chicken was so tender and not bland at all. the sauce was to die for i was literrly licking all the leftoever sauce from the bowl i liked it cause it was spicy like im comin back just for this

Chips: the chips were amaiazin! I couldnt stop eating them not greasy supper flavorful not stale or old. U could really taste the fennel flavor. The sauces were so good. It tastes better if u eat the chips with both sauces at the same time cause ones sweet n the other is acidic and spicy

I LOVE INDIAN FOOD~
Some of my friends get slightly annoyed when I say that cause my tastebuds are pretty basic when it comes to indian food, but chicken makhani and chicken biriyani are my lifeline. But theyre so good, I can't seem to change up my order.. yet. 

Anyways my boyfriend and I were in the area and were planning on going to Rangoli, but it was closed on Monday and Cumin was just right around the corner of where we were at the time. We walk in around 5:30pm on a Monday and the place was pretty empty. I think we were the third table to come in for dinner. We ordered the chicken makhani, the chicken vindalu one rice and one naan to share. Some of the reviews say that the portions are small but we ended up taking at least 1/3 of the meal home. But we do eat a lot less than the standard customer. Also, there was a lot of meat in our curry and I actually wish there was less meat and more sauce.  

But omg the taste was so good. It was probably the second best chicken makhani I've ever had in my life. Also the naan was delicious. 

The only thing that left more to be desired was the service. Our waiter probably said a total of 5 words to us the entire course of the meal and when we asked for more of the side, he nodded but never brought out anymore. He also never stopped by our table except to take our order. 

TL;DR
5/5 Food, 2/5 Service
I would takeout from here again.

By far the best Indian/Nepalese good I've ever had. I highly recommend coming here if you're iffy with this food group. Flavorful, and spicy but not ridiculously spicy. Some people may say it's a little pricy, I think it's worth it. I came here for the lunch buffet and some dinner options. I was never dissatisfied with what I ordered. Try the chicken tikka masala

Last night my father and I went to Cumin in Wicker Park for the first time. Appetizers: Onion Bhaji, Vegetable Samosas. Entrees: Alou Gobi, Paneer Tikka Masala. Side: Garlic Naan. Beverage: water. Service rhythm was measured, well sequenced. The waiter left the menus on the table a little too long/the tables are kinda small so they seemed a bit obtrusive. The art on the wall was a nice touch, as was the lighting, which combined new metallic styles and 70's cloth styled lamps. 

While eating we met an old acquaintance named Nema, which was a pleasant surprise from the West Loop. We discussed old times and friends Antonio and Brendan from our shared days at the La Colombe on Morgan. The small touches are what make places like Cumin and Wicker Park so great, they allow us to bridge different cultures and social groups together. 

Will definitely return when I make a little more money, it's not very cheap (but my father paid ;)

Cumin is a great choice if you're planning to dine in for some Indian/Nepalese food. The atmosphere is relaxed and tables are clean. Staff here are also very professional and nice. 

- mango lassi (5/5): must have! really thick and creamy, good sweetness from the mango balanced with tartness from the yogurt
- chicken momo (3.5/5): worth getting especially if you've never tried this version of dumplings. Has a strong cumin flavor. I'll probably pass on this in the future.
- goat chhoela (3.5/5): this was a new one for me and I appreciated the nice blend of spices and herbs infused in the goat meat. The portion is huge for an appetizer. I did find the goat meat a bit tough though. Will also pass on this next time
- chicken makhani (4.5/5): very tender, nicely done. Butter chicken is always a safe bet
- navaratan korma (5/5): one of my favorite versions of a vegetable cashew curry dish ever! They really nailed this one. Definitely order this. 
- tandoori roti (3.5/5): maybe because it's made with whole wheat, but I found it to be very dense and thick. I suggest sticking to naan.
- cumin peas rice (4/5): nothing crazy, it's basically plain basmati rice upgraded with some spices and peas

- mango lassi (5/5): must have! really thick and creamy, good sweetness from the mango balanced with tartness from the yogurt
- chicken momo (3.5/5): worth getting especially if you've never tried this version of dumplings. Has a strong cumin flavor. I'll probably pass on this in the future.
- goat chhoela (3.5/5): this was a new one for me and I appreciated the nice blend of spices and herbs infused in the goat meat. The portion is huge for an appetizer. I did find the goat meat a bit tough though. Will also pass on this next time
- chicken makhani (4.5/5): very tender, nicely done. Butter chicken is always a safe bet
- navaratan korma (5/5): one of my favorite versions of a vegetable cashew curry dish ever! They really nailed this one. Definitely order this. 
- tandoori roti (3.5/5): maybe because it's made with whole wheat, but I found it to be very dense and thick. I suggest sticking to naan.
- cumin peas rice (4/5): nothing crazy, it's basically plain basmati rice upgraded with some spices and peas

To be honest, after seeing the prices online I was very skeptical about this place. Sure, the food is expensive ($15 for tikka masala) but it is REALLY GOOD. 
You can tell a lot of time goes into preparing these dishes and the spices and flavors are really on point. 
I'll definitely be going back for more of that addicting tikka masala.

Overpriced and mediocre. Ate in one time. Another time, ordered delivery for 4 people and we only ordered 3 entrees to share, naan, and another side. $80. And not even enough for leftovers. The quantities were small for what we paid. Will not be going back.

Very good Indian food. Not too spicy but flavor packed. For appetizer we shared two kinds of samosas. One with lamb and one with chickpeas, chutney and other delicious ingredients. If you like samosas I highly recommend.  Atmosphere and service was good. I will go there again to try other dishes. You will not be disappointed.

I have been to the lunch buffet multiple times.  It is good and fast.  Finally went for dinner and could not have been more disappointed.  Ordered a, glass of wine.  It was oxidized.  I then noticed they kept tin foil over the bottles.  Ordered the fish tandoori.  It should have been called Salt Tandoori.  I will return for lunch, but not dinner.

This has to be one of the best places in Chicago to get Indian food. Everything was perfectly spiced and the portions where a good size. I'll definitely be hitting up Cumin again.

I recommend trying
*Chicken Madras
*Palak Paneer
*Chicken Momo

Flavorful, delicious Indian food. I'm only upset that I ever have to decide between naan and rice except that I always have to order both. Their staff is pleasant but reserved. Had to go twice in the first week that I had ever been. Pricey, but typical for Indian food.

Delicious place with delicious food! The decor is a little "European early 2000s" for a Himalayan/Nepalese place, but the food is to die for. The fragrance of spices invites one in from the very entrance, and makes ones mouth water almost instantaneously. The service is swift, courteous and polite, the food perfectly seasoned, tender, and absolutely "melt-in-your-mouth". The pricing also more than decent. All-in-all a terrific place and I will surely be back! :)

I've been in the restaurant once and also ordered take out.  I haven't dined at a lot of Indian restaurants so I don't have a lot to compare is to, but the food is good.   I've tried the lamb and veggie samosa.  I found the veggie one a little bland but really enjoyed the lamb. I love the garlic naan ($4.50).  Good chicken tikka masala although it is a little expensive ($15) for the amount of chicken you get.  (You also order the rice separately).  However, given that the dish is very rich, it is plenty and the sauce is darn tasty. I  have also tried the lamb vindaalu ($17) - very spicy and too much for me to do on my own.  I preferred the taste of the lamb curry ($17) or lamb biryani ($17)  I'd order both. 

Service is so-so particularly dining in and they don't have a huge selection at the bar.  I prefer take out.

Excellent Indian food in a nice setting. Service is consistently good. I'v been to this restaurant 4 different times and have zero complaints. Food comes out hot and perfectly prepared. While noting unique, this remains on my short list when I am craving no nonsense good Indian food and don't want to make the trek to Devon Ave.

I've been searching for good Indian food since moving to Chicago, and everyone that I have asked has raved about Cumin. I didn't have reservations when I came here on a Sunday night, and thankfully it wasn't too busy and we got seated right away. I got the vegetable samosas and chicken tikka masala with regular naan. Overall, everything was good, but nothing stood out for me. The chicken in the tikka masala was SO tender (amazing), but there was no real flavor to it. Overall, the food and service was good and I would come back again, but the food did not blow my mind.

So kind of embarrassing but I went across the city for lunch just to eat here. I've heard of this place before and it was on my "hit list" for ages, so I was scared I had hyped it up in my head. THANKFULLY that was not true! This place is a great spot, I can say from a lunch buffet point of view (I only came in for Butter Curry honestly but for a $14 lunch buffet--including tax--of this caliber I was floored) they serve a very quality driven selection of foods--also every buffet comes with naan so don't worry if you're like me and while you love rice can't help but need some fresh naan with a good curry. 

Service was great and you could tell that they had a consistently steady stream of customers as well as to go orders, vouching for how good this place is among a neighborhood known for all its foodie driven crevices and spots.

Can't wait to go back for dinner!

Cumin's cuisine is easily 4-5 stars for me and I'd love to return for the food, but their waitstaff structure and high cost make it a place that I wouldn't go out of my way to do so.

Our main issue was with how slow service was and they weren't even that busy. It seemed like every time someone came to our table it was a different person; thus, we'd have a waiter drop off beer but they'd scurry off and not take our entre order. When entres did arrive, they were delivered by another waiter and other items were missing. We'd ask for something from someone else and wouldn't receive it, so we had to ask another person and then wait as they ran around to other tables that were also experiencing the same problems as we were.

3 of the 4 of us ordered beer and we also got 2 appetizers, A Mosaic Samosa (vegetable) and Chicken Momo, that were split into half a samosa and 2 momo per person. We then got an order of Garlic Naan that provided us with half a piece each. On top of that, we had 4 main dishes - Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Makhani / Butter Chicken, Shrimp Vindaloo and Navaratan Korma. It's  la carte here, so Basmati Rice was an additional $3 and the plate wasn't packed with rice. We had to order 2 to have enough for all of our dishes. It ended up coming out to about $25 for the person who had ordered her beer at the bar and $36 for the rest of us before tip was added on. I simply don't feel the amount of food we got was worth that much money since it was small portions of the appetizers and a couple scoops of each entre.

I would suggest coming for their Lunch Buffet because the food was prepared very well, but it's costly if you come for dinner. I notice that price gap at a lot of Nepalese and Indian restaurants, so it's somewhat expected, but it seemed even more so at this one.

The review is for delivery. We were shocked by the very low quantity of food offered. We ordered malai kofta and navratna korma. The malai kofta was very low. Did not fill the take out container. Given the relatively high prices, the low quantities are unacceptable to me. They also give NO rice with the curries now. Bill was close to $36 and all we got was two low quantity curries, (no naan, and no rice). I was made aware that rice would not come with the curry, but I was not prepared for such low quantity. 

Taste: malai kofta was excellent but navratna korma was salty and not too flavorful. It lacked the signature pineapple chunks and slight sweet flavor. 

All in all, didn't find the place to be worth the price.

I really like Cumin's food. The chicken tikka masala is very good! My only complaint is I think the food is a little over priced.

Also my delivery came about a half hour sooner than expected!

I'm afraid this place is getting too big for its britches. The dishes (at least for takeout) do not come with rice nor naan. So a meal for one with bread and rice and a samosa for an appetizer is almost 40 dollars. I don't think I can justify paying that for a dinner joint I want to pop into from time to time. 

I've now also waited 45 minutes for a takeout order that was supposed to take 30 minutes, and still don't have my food. If you're going to be the most expensive Indian restaurant in Chicago, at least honor your take out time.

* naan (2x)
* raaita

Everything was very good. You will need a lot of naan though because there isn't much meat served in the entre dishes. Service was very good if not too attentive at times : )
Very easy to get to off the blue line with a few blocks south of Damen. Very simple environment but lots of vibrant food and conversation. Very friendly staff. Can even get crowded during the week.

The food was very good, but the service was lacking. It took about 15 minutes to get our three glasses of wine. We asked for further descriptions of a couple of dishes, but the server wasn't really able to describe the food/add to the descriptions from the menu. Anyway, we started with the garlic naan and the goat chhoela. Naan was great, so we ordered another basket. The goat chhoela was very good, cooked perfectly, with lots of garlic, some vegetables, and a great blend of spices in the sauce. Then we split the chicken tikka tandoori, which was also very good, served with some lemon, green pepper and onion. The restaurant was very busy, but the server rarely checked in with us and it was hard to get his attention to order more drinks/dishes. Very good food, but service needs to improve.

I hadn't been to Cumin in a few years and disappointed by the changes.  The menu is much smaller than it used to be.  The itself food is good, but they actually charge for rice.  We ordered our entrees and the server didn't even mention that rice wasn't included, so when the food came and we asked about the rice, he looked at us like we were crazy to expect it.  So we each ordered rice, and the server didn't mention that one serving was enough for two people, so we ended up with way too much rice. When this place first opened, I feel like the quality was much better.  I don't think I'll ever go back there.

One of my favorite restaurants in the city. The service has always been great and the food comes out pretty fast. I have had chicken, goat and lamb dishes here and all of them were outstanding. You can easily share things or have an entree for yourself. Everything is very flavorful. Beware anything the servers say is spicy is EXTREMELY spicy. I love that but if you're not ready for food that hot keep that in mind.

Checked out this place for their buffet lunch and had an OK time. 

The buffet was pretty reasonable at $13 for AYCE.  There were 6 different hot dishes--chicken tikka masala, paneer tika masala, lamb curry, a cabbage/veg dish and 2 others I did not try.  There was also tandoor chicken and vegetable pakora.  There was a small salad bar with fresh veggies as well. Every table that did buffet also got a basket of warm naan.  The dessert was this warm carrot/milk porridge.  

From what I understand the buffet choices change but I'm happy with what was available during our visit.  You can still order off the regular menu during lunch as well, in case the offerrings of the day do not appeal to you or you have your heart set on something else. 

The tandoori chicken was very tender and flavorful.  The pakora was good too--not overly greasy.  The tikka masalas were good and just mildy spicy.  I liked the lamb curry flavor but wished the lamb pieces were bigger; each piece was very small and its mostly bone--a bit disappointing because I love lamb curry. 

Service was friendly, hovered way too much. I was still eating the last bits on my plate and they came and asked of they could take my plate--and did the same to my friend. It's not like they were hurting for tables. I still hadn't tried the dessert yet...

Cumin is good, the buffet price is right.  There are just other Indian buffets I'd rank a little highter.

I have tried this place with a couple of friends.  This seems to be one of the most acclaimed indian places in Chicago area, not alone wicker park.  We have tried several dishes for dinner.  I thought the food was good, but the price was a little higher for the food I was treated with.  Service was very adequate.

I was skeptical at first and disappointed not a byo. However service was great and they accommodated my dietary needs! Food was delicious and they brought out extra sauces and didn't charge us as some places do! The gf bread is my fav and they kept bringing! Only downside is it did take a while and it was a slow night in there!

(Take out order)
Overall: Great option for Indian food to bring home and chow down on.

The good: The food itself was very good. The chicken was very tender and the sauces were fantastic. From the vindaloo and paneer to the naan and samosas, everything tasted great. Decently priced and reasonable portions.

The bad: Our order took forever, about an hour. It was a busy Saturday night, but an hour for Indian pickup? Seems long. Once we got there to pickup, it took awhile for us to finally get our order. The food didn't have labels so we weren't positive what was what when we opened it. The rice was the only food that was average.

We've lived a block from this place for 6 years. I would guess we have been here maybe 30-50 times.  I've tried probably 70% of the menu.  I have never had dish here that wasn't at least good, usually great.   The lunch buffet is a particularly awesome deal.   

The chefs make real food - you will see (and taste!) the whole spices, chilies, cilantro leaves, pieces of ginger etc. in your dish.  The service is always good.  

It's kinda pricy for carry-out, but we do it anyway (if we're too lazy to dine in) because it's so consistently well-done.

Wow! the food and service here are actually pretty good. It's a good idea to make a reservation. the place was full on a Saturday night. It may be a tad pricy for Indian food but I have to admit the dishes are prepared well and the service is attentive. It's certainly caters to the Midwest palate but it's tasty and not greasy like the places on Devon Ave. It's not the most authentic place but they do what they do very well.

I hadn't been to Cumin in a few years and disappointed by the changes.  The menu is much smaller than it used to be.  The itself food is good, but they actually charge for rice.  We ordered our entrees and the server didn't even mention that rice wasn't included, so when the food came and we asked about the rice, he looked at us like we were crazy to expect it.  So we each ordered rice, and the server didn't mention that one serving was enough for two people, so we ended up with way too much rice. When this place first opened, I feel like the quality was much better.  I don't think I'll ever go back there.

When we arrived there,there was hardly anyone there. The person at reception asked if we had any reservation we said no he seemed a little bit annoyed but seated us anyway. Not welcoming at all bad service but the food was OK. Food came really late and chicken tikka was not fully done.We Will never go there again.

One of my favorite restaurants in the city. The service has always been great and the food comes out pretty fast. I have had chicken, goat and lamb dishes here and all of them were outstanding. You can easily share things or have an entree for yourself. Everything is very flavorful. Beware anything the servers say is spicy is EXTREMELY spicy. I love that but if you're not ready for food that hot keep that in mind.

Checked out this place for their buffet lunch and had an OK time. 

The buffet was pretty reasonable at $13 for AYCE.  There were 6 different hot dishes--chicken tikka masala, paneer tika masala, lamb curry, a cabbage/veg dish and 2 others I did not try.  There was also tandoor chicken and vegetable pakora.  There was a small salad bar with fresh veggies as well. Every table that did buffet also got a basket of warm naan.  The dessert was this warm carrot/milk porridge.  

From what I understand the buffet choices change but I'm happy with what was available during our visit.  You can still order off the regular menu during lunch as well, in case the offerrings of the day do not appeal to you or you have your heart set on something else. 

The tandoori chicken was very tender and flavorful.  The pakora was good too--not overly greasy.  The tikka masalas were good and just mildy spicy.  I liked the lamb curry flavor but wished the lamb pieces were bigger; each piece was very small and its mostly bone--a bit disappointing because I love lamb curry. 

Service was friendly, hovered way too much. I was still eating the last bits on my plate and they came and asked of they could take my plate--and did the same to my friend. It's not like they were hurting for tables. I still hadn't tried the dessert yet...

Cumin is good, the buffet price is right.  There are just other Indian buffets I'd rank a little highter.

3.5 stars.

I have tried this place with a couple of friends.  This seems to be one of the most acclaimed indian places in Chicago area, not alone wicker park.  We have tried several dishes for dinner.  I thought the food was good, but the price was a little higher for the food I was treated with.  Service was very adequate.

I was skeptical at first and disappointed not a byo. However service was great and they accommodated my dietary needs! Food was delicious and they brought out extra sauces and didn't charge us as some places do! The gf bread is my fav and they kept bringing! Only downside is it did take a while and it was a slow night in there!

(Take out order)
Overall: Great option for Indian food to bring home and chow down on.

The good: The food itself was very good. The chicken was very tender and the sauces were fantastic. From the vindaloo and paneer to the naan and samosas, everything tasted great. Decently priced and reasonable portions.

The bad: Our order took forever, about an hour. It was a busy Saturday night, but an hour for Indian pickup? Seems long. Once we got there to pickup, it took awhile for us to finally get our order. The food didn't have labels so we weren't positive what was what when we opened it. The rice was the only food that was average.

Atmosphere: N/A
Service: 7/10
Food: 8/10

We've lived a block from this place for 6 years. I would guess we have been here maybe 30-50 times.  I've tried probably 70% of the menu.  I have never had dish here that wasn't at least good, usually great.   The lunch buffet is a particularly awesome deal.   

The chefs make real food - you will see (and taste!) the whole spices, chilies, cilantro leaves, pieces of ginger etc. in your dish.  The service is always good.  

It's kinda pricy for carry-out, but we do it anyway (if we're too lazy to dine in) because it's so consistently well-done.

Wow! the food and service here are actually pretty good. It's a good idea to make a reservation. the place was full on a Saturday night. It may be a tad pricy for Indian food but I have to admit the dishes are prepared well and the service is attentive. It's certainly caters to the Midwest palate but it's tasty and not greasy like the places on Devon Ave. It's not the most authentic place but they do what they do very well.

I have dined at Cumin before and the food is incredible.  However, yesterday I had a very negative experience.  We had a 6:45 reservation and arrived just before 6:45.  We were seated at 6:45.  When we arrived, there were hardly any people there.  By 6:55, the place was packed.

It was immediately apparent the restaurant was understaffed.  It appeared there were just two front of house staff - the host and one server.  At 6:55 we agreed that if the server did not ask us for a drink order by 7, we would find another place to eat.  7 came and went and we left.

Cumin is a great place but experiences like these don't motivate me to go back anytime soon.  Ample staffing is a prerequisite to any fine dining experience.

Why is the service here SO SLOW!!! I have been here at least 10 times for the lunch buffet, I should learn by now, the food is pretty good... but the wait staff is absolutely terrible.  

The 2 overweight/young guys seriously look like they would rather be cleaning toilets than refilling water and bringing out bread.... they are awful!  Every table next to or beside me I hear them asking for more bread or refill on water.  It's a buffet, you don't even have to do anything, people get their own plates and their own food!  It's really ridiculous.

Getting the check is by far the worst too.... I realized when I am on my last plate from the buffet to ask for it on my walk back to my table.  Then I do the mad dash to have my credit card out by the time the guy comes to drop off the leather bill holder so at least I'm not waiting on them!  Ugh so frustrating!!!!

My boyfriend and I don't go out to eat very often.  So we were excited to be out and not cooking at home.  Sadly we were disappointed with the food.  The service was good, nice ambience.  But if you are vegan/vegetarian, don't bother going here.  Bland food which shouldn't be the case with Indian food!  Most of it has some kind of dairy, so not many vegan dishes on the vegetarian menu to begin with. 
Small portions and a large bill.  We didn't feel like we got our money's worth.  Should have just driven to Devon!

To cure my craving for Nepali/Indian food, I went to this restaurant directly from the airport. It was my first time in this restaurant. Being a Nepali I can definitely say, they have good authentic Nepali food. A must try is Nepali dumplings or momos ( that would go for every Nepali restaurant you visit). Their chicken curry with basmati rice and Nepali tea is equally delicious. If you like samosa, they do have decent samosa. Their service is also very nice. I saw them serving customers even beyond their hours so I thought that was great. Cant wait to go back again. Just wish it was closer to my home.

By far and away, our favorite Indian spot in the city. Everything is spot on, including a great location in bucktown to bars and night life. 

We usually order the eggplant, which is the best I have ever had. Tikka masala is also amazing as is almost everything else we have ordered. 

The atmosphere is casual, yet classy.  Some people are dressed up while others are off the street. 

The food is authentic and we love it here - our preferred spot whenever we're doing Indian.

Delicious food, awesome service. We had a party of 5 and we walked into a almost completely full restaurant late Saturday evening. We were greeted by the manager who worked with us to arrange for seating without a long wait. 

The servers were extremely polite. We had almost all of their Nepalese goat preparations. The meat was tender and fresh ( we know our goat meat ). The momos were juicy and well made. Overall our party of 5 picky eaters had a great time. Such good service so late in the evening in a Indian / Nepalese restaurant is not easily available.

This was worst experience ever . I was there yesterday for my husbands birthday celebration. Service is 0 . I ordered 2 naan they gave me 1 . I told them that I ordered 2 they were like ok we will get another one . We were eating and waiting for the naan for 30 mins Nobody come . Food was not cooked correctly and at the end I have to go to the register to pay the bill . They were not doing their service at all .

This wonderfully aromatic restaurant is well named.

The menu offers a wide range of classic Indian dishes, some with a twist. For example, the naan bread is very thin, almost like flatbread, but with a bubbly crisp crust around the edge. We had the garlic version, and it was some of the best I've had. Because of its thinness, it wasn't too filling, yet made a great scoop for picking up sauce.

We tried three entrees. The shrimp saag was rich and had a good spinach taste amidst the spices, but the strong flavors made the inclusion of shrimp pointless. Next time I would get it without any protein.

Chicken Madras was extremely creamy, and the chicken was moist and succulent. I hadn't had this dish before, and really enjoyed it.

But by far the best was the lamb korma, not so much because of the lamb (which was fine, but not tender and succulent like the chicken) but because of the wonderfully complex flavors in the korma sauce, one of the best versions I've tasted.

The meal starts with a basket of papadums and two sauces, mint, and tamarind. The mint sauce was a bit thinner than some, and I like more cilantro in mine, but the tamarind sauce was outstanding, almost like fresh cherries in its fruitiness. Very different from the dark, cloying versions served most places.

Service was extremely friendly and helpful. There are a large number of nice wines by the glass. 

The place is cozy and upscale, and the cooking smells waft down the street. For a fine meal, just follow your nose to Cumin.

worst service ever. 

Wait 30 mins for food for three people. Another wait 15 mins to get back the card for check only to find out OVERCHARGED. The bill is supposed to be evenly split into three. But The waiter charged  two times for one card and another card for half of the price. We are soooo angry since the waiter don't admit his mistake and blame the machine for the whole thing. We asked for the manager and he never came. We only get a card of the manager at last and they told us if there is still any wrong charge we could call.
I am still mad. 

Why is this place rated 4 star?
The food is just average but the price is too high. This is the first and only Indian restaurant I entered ever charged for nang. 
I saw a lot low rates similar to mine. How could this place be rated 4? Advertisement fee??????

My advice: there are so many good places in wicker park. Don't come to this one.

Soooo disappointing. Was really desperate for a decent curry - been too long since I last had one back in the uk - the home of the curry. Unfortunately at cumin the only good thing was the Naan - which was very good!

The chicken jalfrezi and the lamb madras were like korma back home and pretty much made from the same masala sauce. Essentially they just added whatever meat was requested.

The place was busy all evening until about 9:30, so the locals obviously like it.

I came here with a group of ladies one evening for dinner. You can tell when you are getting closer because you can smell it from down the street - Yum! It is a smaller restaurant, so I can see how it could get crowded when they are busy. However, the night we came, they were not busy.

Overall, we loved the food. We ordered  the Mosaic Samosa (vegetable) and Chicken Momo appetizers, an order of Garlic Naan, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Makhani / Butter Chicken, Shrimp Vindaloo and Navaratan Korma. Everything was delicious. However, the portions were small and pricey for what you get. We also had to order more rice (we each got one scoop for 4 dishes). That was an extra $3. Seems silly.

Our main issue was with how slow, unorganized service. We never had a consistent waiter, we had to ask for things more than once and wait around for a long time before receiving it, and it took forever to get the bill paid. That was disappointing. 

The food is great, but between the poor service and heightened prices, I'm not convinced that it is a 4-5 star place.

I feel like the only people who review this place so well are people who don't know what truly good Indian food is. If you want good Indian food try going to Jai pur or a restaurant in an actual Indian neighborhood, Devon. I pass up this place all the time, it always smelled so delicious and when I came in I was just really disappointed. The food was alright, but I definitely would not recommend it to anyone.

My husband and I have been coming here multiple times a year since they opened, actually looked forward to it ever since the sign went up in the window. Funny story. Back before it opened we were in Champaign, Illinois for a conference and held our banquet at an Indian restaurant there. When I spoke to the hostess to compliment them on the food she told me the chef was moving to Chicago to open his own place, and it turned out to be Cumin! He's done well for himself. Everything on the menu is delicious, although I think they may have cut some of the Nepalese items off the menu. I could be wrong, but it seemed more limited than I remember. 

Anyway, couple of tips. Try their buffet if you get a chance. You must try the onion bhaji; it is to die for. Definitely make a reservation if you plan on eating there on Friday or Saturday night. This past Friday, April 1, it was packed when we got there at 7:15 PM, and overflowing by the time we left at about 8:30 PM. And be patient with the servers when its crowded. The space is long and narrow, so everyone waiting for a table was packed into the small space just inside the door (with some actually hovering near our table. Not cool!) But it is what it is, a fantastic place to dine on delicious Indian food without having to travel all the way up to Devon Avenue. You can't beat that.

The lamb masala is delicious, but the other items I tried were just okay. The masala sauce was really on point though! The chicken momo was average--- it surprisingly reminded me of Chinese dumplings. I've had better palak paneer--- it just didn't taste that fresh and seemed like it came out of a box. Garlic naan was unimpressive as well.

Service was great though. Maybe I should have come for the lunchtime buffet instead.

But it is what it is, a fantastic place to dine on delicious Indian food without having to travel all the way up to Devon Avenue. You can't beat that.

The lamb masala is delicious, but the other items I tried were just okay. The masala sauce was really on point though! The chicken momo was average--- it surprisingly reminded me of Chinese dumplings. I've had better palak paneer--- it just didn't taste that fresh and seemed like it came out of a box. Garlic naan was unimpressive as well.

Service was great though. Maybe I should have come for the lunchtime buffet instead.

I gave them a bad rating because they took my reservations for a large party and then canceled it the day before. BUT the food here is so yummy! 

They did reach out to rectify their mistake and although my event was not held here - I still return for their super delicious food! The service is great (sans that one time) and the food is superb!

Review for takeout. Dal tadkaa was tasteless. Chicken chilli Masala was completely unappetizing and was not even close to being spicy despite the name. ( chicken lovers never order this). And on top of these two entrees and  2 naans cost $41.00. They have been consistently dropping in quality and getting pricier.My sincere request to the owners to step up their game and not get complacent.

Man, I'm so disappointed. Maybe they were having an "off" night, but service was really awful. My cousin was visiting from out of town so we wanted to bring her to our favorite Indian place! First, we were seated immediately but it took a. LONG. time. to be acknowledged. My cousin ordered a virgin mojito, as she has a heart condition so she can't have alcohol. 20+ minutes after ordering JUST the drinks, they give her an alcoholic mojito. Luckily she only took barely a sip as a precaution. It probably took us 25+ minutes after being seated to place our orders (despite knowing what we wanted right away), and a total of 45 minutes to actually receive our food. Then when my husband asked for a refill on his Diet Coke, the server spilled the refill everywhere! On top of my husband, on his plate, all over the table. And I don't like asking for comps, but they didn't even comp the soda even when the spill pretty much ruined our dinner. I really love their food, so one day I'll eventually be back, but I hope their servers get it together.

Food is not bad but Cumin has possibly the worst service I have experienced in a while! I know sometimes it can be busy and a patron could feel rushed to leave but what I experienced at Cumin would be borderline comical if it wasn't flat out rude. 

We have spent 40min in there at best, during which time our waiter has asked us if we were "done" not less than four times. The third time around the lady I was with was literally putting her last bite of the night onto her fork and almost got her plate swiped as she was putting  food in her mouth. Sure enough one minute later the waiter was back with the same question. That, my friends, is not even unprofessional or rude... that's just disrespectful!

Anyways it would be more than two stars if this was the only bad experience I had during my short stay but unfortunately it wasn't. While trying to scramble for more space the service rearranged some tables next to me in a manner that leaves about a foot of space in between - this caused the waiter to brush against me, as I was eating, with his ASS about 6-7 times. Funny right!? Well I suggest you try it first and then laugh. ;-) Is this the end of the physical pleasantries you can expect at Cumin?  No, of course not... one of the scrambelers grazed me with a hot plate on the top of my head without so much of a hint of an apology! Needless to say I will never come back and will highly recommend to all not to visit Cumin... unless you like paying (too much) money to be treated like a dog. Also, 3.50 for rice on top of 15.00 dish that comes with rice?? GTFOH

I've eaten at Indian restaurants all around the world. Britain, around the US, all over india. This is my favorite. Just my opinion, but the taste is exceptional. And the thought that is put behind each dish illustrates the chef's care for each dish.

CUMIN DELIVERS! It's a masala miracle.

I've tried a few things from their menu, but the chicken tikka masala is classic for a reason. It's a mouth-watering, belly-warming, hangover-curing, bowl of goodness. The mullingtawny soup is my next fave. 

Seriously, go to Cumin if you're craving Indian food. There's naan better!

I need to start off by saying that, I am the biggest indian food enthusiast that I know. Indian food is one of my absolute favorite foods, and I have been to every single known name indian restaurant in chicago, followed by the small , tiny hole In the wall joints.  

It's a Thursday, and I had somethings to do , so I skipped out on going to Niles to Himalayan restaurant(my number one favorite within city limits) to go somewhere local , so I chose Cumin. 

This place is beautiful inside when I walk in, and a nice man greets me and proceeds to talk me to sit where ever I would like. It's a buffet , that included butter chicken, khasi ko masu( Nepalese goat curry) dal mahkani , palak and a special vegetable mix. I load a little of every thing on my plate and go to sit down to devour this. As I sit, I notice I only have two knifes and no fork. I ask the host for a fork, and he proceeds to tell me that there are forks on the table. He walks away, and I still have no fork , so I grab one from the nearest table.

As I began to eat, immediately, I was pretty disappointed. The food flavor was very off to me on so many levels. The khasi, which is more aromatic than a traditional indian goat curry, lacked flavor. It missed cinnamon or cardamom...something was very lacking in this dish, and considering it's my favorite goat curry, It was a huge let down.

The butter chicken was not bad, but not the best either. It could've had a stronger flavor. The dal was the worst, lacked a lot of salt and spices and aromatics. I could've gone with out tasting this. The best things on my plate were the palak(spinach) and the chefs vegetable mix.  They were REALLY good, but the lack of flavor in the meat dishes really can't be compromised. 

All in all , for only 1 dollar LESS, I could've went to Himalayan and called it a day. That's what I should've done and I will do next time. I may try this place again, but will never eat the buffet again.

I'm weary of trying Indian restaurants not in Devon. Being Indian, you critique restaurant-quality Indian food very differently from others. There are a couple of standard menu items that help discern if where you're eating is the real deal or completely whitewashed. I had pretty low expectations for Cumin, given that it's in yuppie-central Wicker Park (it's okay, I live in Wicker so I'm being honest about my own neighborhood). I was surprised to find that the food is not only authentic, but delicious and fairly clean. Not too heavy on cream or butter like other Indian spots. I'd recommend the goat curry and off-menu malai kofta (if you ask they'll make it). Rich flavors, great interiors, nice ambiance. Total gem. And it's open on a lot of holidays (I went there on Xmas Day when everything else was closed)!

Great food when you dine in, horrible for pick-up orders. I've called on at least five occasions to place an order where the phone line is disconnected during business hours or I'm put on hold and then hung up on. Just got put on hold tonight for 15 minutes and then they hung up. So sick of it!

Just ate here for the first time with some friends....food was decent - not incredible...but WAY too expensive, especially for the quality/amount.  Rice is extra?  Kid who brought our plates to the table just stood with plates and expected us to get up and come get the plates I guess?  Eventually he held them one at a time out in front of himself and we had to get up and reach across the table to get our plates.  Really odd - don't you usually just walk around the table and set them down in front of people?  He also had NO idea what the entrees were and who ordered what - took a while to figure all that out, and I still got the wrong entree.  Ate it anyways (Chicken Masala)...had way too many hard chunks of something in it.  Definitely better options (even nearby) for Indian food.

Very nice, clean, tight table space in a great location in Wicker Park if you're looking for Indian. I also haven't visited many Indian Restaurants in Chicago as I love to cook Indian at home so I don't have much to compare too but I think this is a great place for probably 2-4 people. They take reservations by phone and are very friendly and professional. 

Don't come too hungry. The wait is long after you sit unless you order a drink. They do have a cocktail list- but I think Indian food is heavy so I wouldn't do a fancy cocktail but of course, that's your preference! Anything on the menu is great! I would recommend trying one dry dish, and one curry dish. For example, butter chicken and goat biryani. Don't forget the naan! Perfect to share, a large amount, and you will always have enough to take home!

I LOVE INDIAN FOOD. When I fall in love with an Indian restaurant, I return over and over and over. When I was in undergrad, I went to this one Indian restaurant an average of 3x a month for about 6 months (and then slowed it down to once every couple of months for reasons of saving money and my scale... lol). This wouldn't be impressive if not for the fact that I was maxing out my dining out budget AND I had to drive super far every time.

The buffet is good, I will say that. Came right when it opened on a Saturday and it was fresh food with a decent selection of mains and sides. Their fruit bar was varied and surprisingly in-season and their kheer was bomb (I am picky about kheer because the aforementioned favorite restaurant had amazingggg kheer).

Naan is okay, but I prefer garlic over plain naan (which they didn't have with the buffet)!

Also, you know those pieces of plastic that hold pricetags to clothes? Those clear ones that look like a T? I found one of those in my curry. Actually, I was eating a bite of the curry and I was like... this is hard... and then took it out and yep... it was a piece of plastic. I told them about it and the guy was like "oh... yea it probably came from our baskets or something," which I didn't quite understand. No effort to really apologize or make up for it. 

If you take into account the price (I think it's $15 per person?) and the incident, it's a 3 star place. If we're talking about just the food and no other bias, it might be a 3.5-4. The food is tasty, but not insanely delicious enough to warrant craving any of the dishes. I might be back in 1/2-1 year, maybe not... on to try more Indian Restaurants!

Went for a Sunday lunch/brunch.

What we didn't know was it was a buffet.  

The staff was nice.  

I just found the food to be very mediocre.  They had chicken wings, veggie fritters, salad, fruit, mushroom mix, creamed spinach, chicken, goat, etc.  none of it was that impressive.  They did bring out fresh bread to the table.

The desserts were rice pudding and the sweet noodles...meh.

Overall, it was $15...not bad for a variety but I would rather have just ordered off the menu and potentially had something better.

Soooo good. Chicken Madras, poori, garlic naan, basmati rice with a glass of red wine. The only downside was one of the waiters. He was rude and impatient with my friend who was taking a bit longer to order. It was a very overwhelming menu, especially if you've never had Indian food before. Other than that, the food was well worht it. Thanks, Cumin you just made me a huge fan of Indian food.

This place is cute and gets super busy around the weekends. We were lucky to get a table Friday night. The seating is kind of crammed together, but at least they try to maximize space.

I ordered the Chicken Madras - curry with coconut milk. The chicken was moist and good. We also ordered sides of paneer naan and garlic naan, also very good.

The mango cocktail was very sweet and tasty with fresh mangos.

I wish I had more specific things to say about the flavor profile or something intriguing besides "good," but I will go again and then let you know if I come up with better positive adjectives.

Great place to get Indian and Nepalese food in Chicago, and one of the few ones that is actually a pleasure to eat.  Most of the good indian restaurants are up on Devon and Nepalese food is hard to come by (there's a Nepalese restaurant in S. Loop and another one in Evanston, but besides that, not sure if there is any other ones outside of Cumin).  

Food is delicious, I've eaten a fair number of vegetarian dishes here and have been quite impressed at the quality of food.  I'd suggest eating the Channa Batura and the Paneer Tikka as they were really good last time I was there.  The traditional black eye pea dish from Nepal is something I always get and always enjoy.  

There was one time I was put off by the service as they gave me and my parents the cold shoulder, but it seems an isolated instance as the other times, the service has been pretty good.

I'm an Indian food virgin and the girlfriend wanted to pop my cherry. So we came to Cumin.   Arrived at 1st dinner seating, 5pm.  Had the restaurant all to ourselves which makes this all so frustrating. 

Simple and short, service was a nightmare.  

Having absolutely no idea what I was eating, I had questions.  Waiter wasn't rude, he just didnt understand me.  Which makes the dining experience uncomfortable.  Rather than be difficult and maybe calling someone else over, I simply just trusted all the things my girlfriend ordered.

I saw the waiter twice.  Once when he took our order and once when he brought the bill.  Horrible.  

The food was tasty, I enjoyed it but small portions. 

Since there was a language barrier, he never brought the appetizer we ordered.  And since he was MIA, I couldn't bring it to his attention.  Normally I would say this dude was having an off night but unfortunately that is not the case.

I wanna be able to have a conversation with my server.  Especially when Im venturing into the unknown :)

I want him to educate me on the culture, elevate my dining experience.  Show me and recommend all the wonderful Indian dishes that I've been missing out on.  I guess if I was on Devon Ave it comes with the territory.   But cmon... This is a new modern hip restaurant in Wicker Park.  Unacceptable. 

Unfortunately this place fell short, waaaay short.  $70 tab before tip(2 people), no leftovers, NO THANK YOU.

I love Indian food!!! And was so excited that my husband who can't handle the spices sometimes agreed to try Cumin.  We went early on a Saturday evening, and the place was already filling up, but luckily we didn't have to wait long for a seat.  The food we had was tasty, but service was a little slow.  Also, the restaurant is really small so they had the table right next to each other.  There was a couple breaking up right next to us, and there was no way to avoid the conversation, since we were so close it was like we were having dinner with them.

I came here on a first date with my girlfriend a few mere days after moving to Wicker Park. We came in on a weekday evening and were seated easily without reservations. Our waiter had a pretty strong accent, which made it a little difficult to understand what he was saying at times. He was very cordial and an excellent server, though, which certainly made up for the small language barrier issue. We were very well taken care of throughout the evening. 

To start, we got two orders of garlic naan, a favorite for both of us. It was served piping hot with a distinct garlic flavor. It was perfectly salted; there was no need to add anything else. For my entree, I ordered the lamb madras, which entailed "boneless lamb cooked in a savory and exotic coconut-flavored creamy curry sauce with delicious indian spices and curry leaves" (quote taken from the menu). I loved the coconut curry sauce and enjoyed that it didn't taste overly spicy. I can handle some spice and I didn't find this baby spicy at all, really. 

This was a great date night spot, especially for a first date! The atmosphere was romantic and classy, it was not overly expensive, we could easily converse without any loud conversations from the tables next to us or music playing, and (the best of all, in our case) the menu was really vegetarian friendly while still catering to meat eaters. My girlfriend doesn't eat meat and I'm a bloodthirsty carnivore, so the menu options boded well for the both of us. If we are ever in the mood for Indian/Nepalese cuisine in the future, Cumin will be the obvious choice.

We were craving Indian food so we decided to go to Cumin as there are not many Indian places in Chicago that offer a lunch buffet. The food was very good and there was a decent selection. For around $15 a person, it is also very affordable. We will be back.

Great little Nepalese and Indian food place in Wicker Park. They have an amazing all you can eat lunch buffet for just $13! They have tandoori veggies, butter chicken, palak paneer, and soooo many more entrees, and a killer rice pudding for dessert. Plus their naan was incredible. Go here asap.

Excellent food, great ambience:
Our food order:
App- Chicken momos- great flavor, make sure to request for the spicy housemade sauce (mild hot)
Entree- Nepalese goat curry, chicken madras
Bread- onion kulcha and green chili naan

Everything was perfect. Spice level- Mild.

Highly recommended!!

There are few dishes that are as game changing//life altering than the Gobi Manchurian at Rangoli. If you think you've had Cauliflower, think again, mate.

This place is seriously as good as it gets on a number of accounts and the food is just where it should be when rating a resty. At the very tip top.

The Extraordinary garlic naan and equally delectable Chicken Biryani are almost an afterthought to the Gobi ManC! 

[X] Don't even think about missing this one.

After hopping on GrubHub during a lazy evening consisting of staying in and watching a Cub's game, I had narrowed my cuisine desires to Indian food, Thai food or Greek food. Our group took a vote (how democratic of us) and we opted for ordering some Rangoli to the house. 

The order came in the expected amount of time & the order was completed accurately so absolutely no complaints there. 

It just wasn't my favorite Indian food.... my two go-to Indian dishes are Malai Kofta & Shahi Paneer. So, I ordered the Malai Kofta & Jordan ordered the Paneer Butter Masala (as they did not have any Shahi paneer on the menu).  The sauce for the Malai Kofta was delectable, creamy and really delicious! However, the kofta/dumplings were SO dry that they were hard to eat. The dish would have honestly been better without them since the sauce was amazing! The Paneer Butter Masala also had a delicious sauce & a good portion of paneer, but the overabundance of green peppers was a little off-putting. 

For an appetizer, we decided on the Veggie Samosas, which were large, crispy and really tasty. I would recommend them & probably order them again. 

The spice levels were accurate with mild being mild in taste, medium being medium and spicy was DEFINITELY spicy! 

For my go-to dishes this is not my favorite Indian restaurant, but they do have great flavors on the sauces, great samosas and prompt/accurate delivery.

Let me start by saying that the food is excellent. I wish that I could rate on the food alone. 

Service, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired. And if you are dining out, there's more to the experience than just the food.

After spending a decent amount on several courses, my wife and I were asked by a waiter (he identified himself as Ritick - I am sure the spelling is incorrect) to leave because he "needed our table".  I'd say we were at the restaurant for a little over an hour, eating and enjoying the bottle of wine we brought.

The restaurant was not full. There were no people waiting for a table in the restaurant. And the hordes of people that "Ritick" claimed were waiting at the bar next door, didn't seem to come running into Rangoli as my wife and I waited another 10 minutes for our Uber to arrive in front of the restaurant.

Dining out is an experience. It's unfortunate that Rangoli's poor service had to ruin ours. With so many good options in Chicago, I'd advise getting it to go or choosing another spot that values customers and wants them to return.

Was very excited to try this highly recommended restaurant, especially because they are local and deliver. We ordered food at 6:45 tonight and it still has not arrived, we placed 3 phone calls over the course of the 2nd hour and talked to three different people who told us the driver was on the way... on the first call we find out they had taken down our address wrong (common mistake) but clearly not communicated to the driver after the calls or 1 or 2. At 8:41 I called spoke to whom
I presume is a manager or owner who was very apologetic but also unwilling to refund our $50 order or give any explanation other than the restaurant was very busy. As I type this, I am still hungry and waiting and disappointed that our first experience with a restaurant others speak so highly of may have turned us off complete. 3 stars at the thought the food might still show up and taste good.
Don't deliver if you can get it right (ps. This was not a grub hub or other order, it was placed directly on the phone) Rangoli, take ownership. This is completely frustrating experience.

This was my go to indian food place when I lived nearby. We usually get our staples of Aloo paratha and Lamb Vindaloo plus whatever we feel like that day. Depending when you come the wait for a table can take a while, because if you sit down to eat you'll realize THE FOOD takes a while. However, wait aside it is one of the more flavorful indian dishes I have had around Chicago. In addition, the spicy is legitimately spicy. If I'm going for spicy indian dishes I want my socks to catch on fire. It is also BYOB. Parking is relatively easy to find. The restaurant is kind of small so I notice a lot of people getting take out rather than trying to wait for a table. Aside from the aloo paratha and lamb vindaloo, we've also had naan, palak paneer, Tarka Dal and butter chicken. I would recommend you try any of those!

Very impressed! Growing up eating Indian food i was satisfied with the food here..  I recommend the paneer with garlic naan with some rice. BYOB is a great plus and the prices were reasonable for the amount of food.  Decor is gorgeous and the atmosphere is very hip and trendy.

Great experience. The staff is friendly and hospitable. We ordered the palak paneer and chicken curry. Both dishes were incredibly flavorful and a bit on the spicy side (which I am a great fan of). Don't be scared off though, it's not too spicy. 
The paneer is perfectly soft and has distinguishable flavor (which is hard to come by). The chicken was SO tender. I don't remember the last time I had chicken that fell apart like this one was. Definitely recommend both.
The dishes don't come with rice so we ordered basmati rice on the side (it's a generous portion) and an order of naan.
The naan was the only (somewhat) let-down. It was rolled too thin and ended up being crispy instead of the wonderful pillowy naan that I've grown to love. 
Still worth the visit but next time I'll likely do take-out and get naan elsewhere.

We use to come here more often until we moved a bit further away. However, when we come we always really enjoy it. Came Friday night and had Tarka Dal, lamb vindaloo and paratha. The food is very high quality, flavor is great, they're honest about the spice level, and it's as close to homemade as I've had that isn't homemade. A few things are keeping me from rating it a 5 star. I believe the prices are a little steep. Again, this may be the belief that all Indian food should be less expensive, but when other places are offering similar options for $4-5 less it's hard to not think this. The quality here is better I believe so that may be a reason. Another reason is the cost of a bowl of rice. If the prices are a tad more I'd appreciate a small bowl of rice to go with my lamb vindaloo. Your only option is a large plate of rice for $4. The main reason is the time to get the food to table was long, as it always is. A 45 minute wait is understandable on a busy night, but we were here at 6 with tables open. It appeared they favored the take out orders over the sit down orders. But I may be wrong. Overall, the food is fantastic. It's BYOB so that saves you some good cash that can be spent on the slightly more expensive, but delicious food. Will be back again soon.

Rangoli was my introduction to Indian food and it was memorable. I didn't know what to get and I wasn't familiar with the spices of Indian cuisine so I took a chance on the dal makhani because it had beans and lentils. The first taste was really a turning point for me because it was so delicious. The interesting combination of spices is what makes Rangoli (and Indian food in general) something special. And if you're a vegetarian, you can't go wrong here because there are so many options. Highly recommend!

Oh Rangoli otherwise know as Rango or dat rang...I should have given you a review a long time ago. It has been years since living in Chicago but I am still in search of a butter chicken equally as good. The smooth texture, vibrant and spicy sauce is unparalleled to anything I've been able to find in years. I still search for butter chicken that can meet the same quality but I continue to be disappointed.

I am pleased to say my first time having Rangoli was pure luck! My Boyfriend woke up this Sunday (01/08/17) morning craving Indian food for lunch and after going down the list of places we've been to, and the number of disappointments, we decided to venture into something new and this is how we came across Rangoli. I should mention that Yelp listed this place as CLOSED on Sundays. We decided to call the restaurant to confirm and luckily for us they answered and confirmed that today they were open for Pickup & Delivery! 

We decided to use the App DoorDash. We kept our order pretty simple with little to no requests, other than heat levels. My boyfriend ordered the Butter Chicken (side of rice $3), Chicken Biryani, and 2 Garlic Naan. I went with the Gobi Manchurian, Mutter Paneer (side of rice $3). Our Total price was pretty high but we were pretty adamant that we have Indian food for lunch! We waited less than an hour for our DoorDash order, it was pretty quick transaction. 

Overall everything was great! The food definitely hit the spot and Rangoli is now on our Top List for Indian food in the city. One thing I will mention is that I personally found the takeout portions to be on the smaller side. As I mentioned this was our first time having Rangoli and as excited as I was when our food came, it was a little bit of a let down seeing the sizing of their takeout containers. I didn't let the portions sizing interfere any further because the minute I tasted the food I was instantly hooked. The food was so flavorful and they definitely delivered on my request for Extra Spicy! My boyfriend loved his orders, no bones in the Butter Chicken and no bones in his Chicken Biryani! 

I am no expert on Indian food but it being one of my favorites I am no stranger to the massive list of Indian restaurants within the Chicagoland area! I know what I like, I know where to stay away from, and personally I know when I can trust a place to deliver 100%.  

I am giving this place 4 stars for 2 reasons. The first being my feelings on their portions and the second being I need to experience dining at the restaurant. With that said, I definitely intend to come back for their dine in experience and to also find out if it adds/takes away from the general feelings I've gathered so far. Stay tuned.

This is my favorite Indian place in the area.  Their Gobi Manchurian is absolutely a must.  The flavors are spicy (in a medium way) and they blend together wonderfully.  It's also a very generous portion.  I am a big fan of their version of Butter Paneer Masala.  The tomato sauce has a perfect balance of creaminess and tomatoey spice.  The paneer chunks are decently sized as well.  Another favorite of mine was the Bhindi Masala, the okra was fresh and the sauce compliments it perfectly.  The only dish that was just okay and did not have a lot of flavor was the Mutter Paneer.

I also love that it's BYOB and the coziness of it is charming.

As an Indian, I'd say that the food is decent. Not in the top 5 of what I'd consider very good indian food. The vegetables selected are basic, they're not doing anything amazing. If you're in the area and want indian food, it's fine. If you want someplace that Indians would say is amazing, go somewhere else.

Not sure that I'd go back...

I can't quite recall what my group ordered here, but I distinctly remember the Gobi Manchurian (fried cauliflower) dish. I was sooooo confused how cauliflower could so deceptively taste like real chicken! It was almost as if I was eating an orange chicken dish--not that I ever order it, because it isn't Chinese food. lol. It does make sense, though, given that it's a Chinese-Indian dish.
I'd come back to try more items, such as their lentil/daahl's, or kulfi, and I'd probably order the lamb curry again! Rangoli's also BYOB, so take advantage of that.

I've been craving Indian food the last week and this sure hit the spot! Small restaurant so try and book a reservation if you can! BYOB and can only take up to two cards when splitting the bill. 

Ambiance: Small cozy restaurant decorated with tapestries and elephant light fixtures. Some large tables that can be shared with multiple small parties. Tables themselves are pretty small. 

Food: Veggie samosas, lamb korma, kofta makhani, paneer butter masala, aloo gobi, NAAN, onion kulcha and plain basmati rice

Veggie somosas: super crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside filled with potatoes and yummy goodness! Be careful once getting them as the filling is hot when first served. Beware of the green sauce, it's super spicy!

Lamb Korma: Second mildest dish we got out of the four and probably once of my favs! The lamb was very tender and the sauce delicious. 

Kofta Makhani: Unfortunately you only get two of the chickpea, potato meatballs :(  Which is weird because we got more lamb in the lamb korma dish and they cost about the same. The sauce was really good though! It could have just used more potato chick pea meatballs. 

Paneer Butter Masala: The mildest dish of the four was really good. Creamy and great for dipping your breads or flavoring your plain rice with. 

Aloo Gabi: This was the spiciest. So incredibly spicy it was too difficult for our party of four to finish. I dont' have a high tolerance for spicy foods so it was difficult to enjoy the flavor. 

Naan: We got the butter and the garlic. If you had to choose go with garlic (it makes everything better). One order is like a whole piece of pita bread. 

Onion Kulcha: It was like the naan, but more seasoned and with pieces of onion and other things. Really flavorful, definitely reccommend!

Basmati Rice: Nothing crazy special, it's just a must to absorb all the flavors of the food!

All in all I felt it was a bit pricey. Having been to India just last month, it felt like I was being gyped! But for 4 orders of samosas, two orders of rice, 3 orders of Naan, 1 order of Kulcha and four main dishes it cost about $25 pp with tip. It was a ton of food too and the four of us have really large appetites. You could make do with one less order of Naan. Don't be fooled either if you feel you're still hungry....let it sit...then you'll feel it. 

Service: Was great! We mistakenly ordered Biryani thinking we were still hungry after finishing everything I listed....as we were sitting waiting for it, we got full. We asked if we could cancel it and it had just finished cooking, but they still canceled it for us anyway. 

I would definitely be back!

Too bad they didn't notify GrubHub or Yelp that they closed early today. I waited for 30 min past the delivery window GrubHub texted me and finally called the restaurant. Their voicemail was full...no answer. Contacted GrubHub... sorry, they closed even their hours say they're open today. Not cool. Yelp also shows them as open right now. --- update. The food was supposed to be here between 7:10 and 7:20 per GrubHub text. I called at 7:50... GrubHub cancelled the order and sent a refund. At 8:35 my doorbell rang and Rangoli delivered our order. I told the driver we cancelled and expected it more than an hour ago. He left the food. I wonder what the heck happened. What restaurant doesn't answer their phone and has a full voicemail? The food here is really good. Next time we call first.

My mouth wants to give this 5 stars.  My bottom and the toilet at my house aren't as enthused.  But....you know what, they still deserve it. This was some of the best Indian food I've ever eaten!  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD THOUGH...beg them to tone down the spicyness.  I LOVE spicy food, but this was just something WAY too intense for even me to handle. The Lamb was cooked perfectly, naan had lots of flavor.  The stuffing on the inside of the samosas were OK, but the great crunch on the outside more than made up for it.  

This place is great.  NEVER take a date here though unless you absolutely want to ruin any probability of getting any action later. :)

Came on a Sunday night around 7 and we were immediately seated.

I heard amazing things about the gobi manchurian so we ordered that and then the butter paneer and the Malai kofta.

The gobi manchurian was very good! I'd order this again. The other two main dishes were mediocre. Maybe I shouldn't have ordered the classic basic af indian dishes. I'd recommend ordering something different that you can't order at other restaurants.

The service was good - they didn't check up on us as much as I would have liked though. 

Solid choice if you're close, but I'd recommend Cumin if you're in the area and want to be wowed.

We didn't just eat dinner at Rangoli - we had a FEAST.  Our group of 3, famished from a long day and a long drive, dove in and decided we'd share a ton of food:

*Veggie Samosas
*Butter Naan (and garlic naan)
*Butter Chicken
*Chicken Haryali
*Chicken Vindaloo
*Rice

In addition to that, Rangoli is BYOB with no corkage fee.  So we also split some bottles of wine.

Everything was delicious, we even ordered more naan to share after devouring the first order.  My favorites were the Butter Chicken, which is my favorite Indian dish, and the Chicken Haryali, which had an interesting flavor from the coconut milk, mint, and coriander.  The least favorite in the group was the Chicken Vindaloo, which had a strong cinnamon-y flavor.

The portions look small at first, but the heavy sauces and meat fill you up fast, so don't be deceived by the small white serving bowls.  We could have easily shared our food with a 4th, and maybe even a 5th, person.

The service was okay.  We had some difficulty communicating with the server.  The language barrier wasn't the problem, but it seemed like he had trouble understanding us even when we were ordering "more naan" and "rice."  He also seemed confused by the amount of food we were ordering.  #FatAmericans

We sat at a table by the front window, which was a cute set-up but turned out to be really uncomfortable.  I'd suggest grabbing a seat at one of the other tables instead.

The food was supposed to be here between 7:10 and 7:20 per GrubHub text. I called at 7:50... GrubHub cancelled the order and sent a refund. At 8:35 my doorbell rang and Rangoli delivered our order. I told the driver we cancelled and expected it more than an hour ago. He left the food. I wonder what the heck happened. What restaurant doesn't answer their phone and has a full voicemail? The food here is really good. Next time we call first.

My mouth wants to give this 5 stars.  My bottom and the toilet at my house aren't as enthused.  But....you know what, they still deserve it. This was some of the best Indian food I've ever eaten!  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD THOUGH...beg them to tone down the spicyness.  I LOVE spicy food, but this was just something WAY too intense for even me to handle. The Lamb was cooked perfectly, naan had lots of flavor.  The stuffing on the inside of the samosas were OK, but the great crunch on the outside more than made up for it.  

This place is great.  NEVER take a date here though unless you absolutely want to ruin any probability of getting any action later. :)

Came on a Sunday night around 7 and we were immediately seated.

I heard amazing things about the gobi manchurian so we ordered that and then the butter paneer and the Malai kofta.

The gobi manchurian was very good! I'd order this again. The other two main dishes were mediocre. Maybe I shouldn't have ordered the classic basic af indian dishes. I'd recommend ordering something different that you can't order at other restaurants.

The service was good - they didn't check up on us as much as I would have liked though. 

Solid choice if you're close, but I'd recommend Cumin if you're in the area and want to be wowed.

The food was between OK & alright.  The restaurant seating is tight and ambiance is not exactly great.  If you happen to be in the neighborhood, it may be worth a try.  It's not quite worth driving from downtown to trek all the way to dine here.

We didn't just eat dinner at Rangoli - we had a FEAST.  Our group of 3, famished from a long day and a long drive, dove in and decided we'd share a ton of food:

*Veggie Samosas
*Butter Naan (and garlic naan)
*Butter Chicken
*Chicken Haryali
*Chicken Vindaloo
*Rice

In addition to that, Rangoli is BYOB with no corkage fee.  So we also split some bottles of wine.

Everything was delicious, we even ordered more naan to share after devouring the first order.  My favorites were the Butter Chicken, which is my favorite Indian dish, and the Chicken Haryali, which had an interesting flavor from the coconut milk, mint, and coriander.  The least favorite in the group was the Chicken Vindaloo, which had a strong cinnamon-y flavor.

The portions look small at first, but the heavy sauces and meat fill you up fast, so don't be deceived by the small white serving bowls.  We could have easily shared our food with a 4th, and maybe even a 5th, person.

The service was okay.  We had some difficulty communicating with the server.  The language barrier wasn't the problem, but it seemed like he had trouble understanding us even when we were ordering "more naan" and "rice."  He also seemed confused by the amount of food we were ordering.  #FatAmericans

We sat at a table by the front window, which was a cute set-up but turned out to be really uncomfortable.  I'd suggest grabbing a seat at one of the other tables instead.

Enjoyed food from here the other day. There's a pretty diverse selection include many of the most popular commercial indian dishes, along with a few regional favorites that I was told to miss when eating here. Ordered the Chana Masala and the Chicken Chettinad, and both were flavored very nicely, robust with spices and without much filler. As another bonus, their base level of spiciness in their dishes seems to be a step above other restaurants, so be cognizant of that before ordering a spice level that will burn off your tongue. The portions were decent as well, though I wish there had been more pieces of chicken in the chicken chettinad. Base prices for their dishes are alright($10-14), though it's sorta bogus that rice and naan cost extra, at least when ordering delivery. $3 for extra rice and $1.50 for a piece of naan? If I'm spending $14 for a medium-size entre for 1, at least spare me that much. 3.5 stars(points off for the whole rice thing).

So the food is really good but I actually suggest ordering takeout or delivery from here.

The restaurant is super tight on space, so on a busy Friday night it can feel cramped. I was here with friends and the restaurant was uncomfortably hot inside for some reason. So while the food is good, the whole dining experience was very, very uncomfortable: cramped and hot as a sauna.

Awesome byob restaurant and they aren't afraid to bring the heat in their food! I came here last weekend and was surprised by the intimate setting and homey feel. It almost feels like you're at a friends house or in an old forgotten cafe. 

Rangoli is a great place to come for a date or even with a group of friends. I had the lamb vindaloo and was floored by the awesome flavor and heat! The lamb was extremely tender and the rice was the perfect doneness. The rice is sold separately from the entrees so make sure to order some on the side!

This is the worst Indian restaurant I have ever eaten. The waiters do not respect the customer.

Ordered one chicken biryani which is the worst biryani of my lifetime. The biryani is light green in color and I have never ever seen in my lifetime. It should be called as coriander rice with chicken on the side. The taste is really worst.

Ordered chicken 65 which says it is spicy and it is like eating rocks. The chicken 65 is so hard.

Ordered one Chicken Hariyali and 2 tandoori roti. The chicken Hariyali is supposed to be spicy with chillies and however chillies are almost quarter inch in size. 

I mentioned that I will not pay fo Chicken 65 and the waiter mentions that I have tasted the biryani and hence have to pay for it.

While we are eating, couple of customers walked by and wants to seat near by the door which has 3 seats. The waiter denied both the customers as the seating is for 3 people and there are only two people. The customers were so frustrated and left the restaurant. I am really happy that the customers left as they will definitely find a better restaurant than this. The customers are lucky not to have this kind of food which is not even worth a penny.

I will never ever visit this restaurant in my lifetime even if they offer free food or pay in return. 

I suggest not to visit this restaurant and find a better Indian restaurant.

When I asked for the store manager number, they denied to give the number.  They do not even care losing customers. 

 Please for God sake, hire good waiters who can treat customers better. 

If there is an option to give negative rating, I would give this restaurant the least negative rating.

I had heard great places of this Humboldt Park hot spot for Indian cuisine, so I wanted to see what it was all about.  

Atmosphere: This place is small and gets filled and a cramped waiting area is quickly followed.  Everyone is sitting on top of each other after you are seated, so prepare to befriend the people next to you.

Service: Our server the evening my friend and I went was TERRIBLE!!!  The guy came by once..to bring the bill after we finished and after he had taken our order.  Otherwise we never saw him.  

Food: The night we we t the food was bland and flavorless and the naan wasn't that great.  After all the great things I had heard I expected a lot more from it.  

With so many other good places to try, it will be a long time before I give this place another shot.

Unreasonably spicy. 

Much of the time when a menu denotes that an entree is spicy, this is also related via the order taker. Or a question is asked, like.. Did you notice that this entree is spicy? Or, can we suggest a level of spice. Or do you realize that we plan to fuck you up? This should be relayed to everyone. 
In case they don't pick up on this, note Yelpers: it's fucking spicy. Like.. I can feel heartburn acidic feelings right now.. 

The place is decked out with Indian themed handicrafts that set some mood. The music adds to the scene but only when someone is paying attention and arranging the sound machine to play. Until then, the volume is down and it's solely the chitter-chatter of other tables around you. 

The space is uber cozy. You're inside of other people's conversations and your group is admiring the plates around you. More than often, I bet the same entrees are hitting table after table. This could be a good date spot, if your date can handle spice. (Even when I told them to make it spicy but very light spice, it gave me a constant bead of sweat across my forehead and scalp. Ain't nobody need to sweat like that on a date.) 

A few fan favorites; gobi machurian, butter chicken, samosas and biriyani. The filling of the samosas is potato and its content has a bit of spice. Good stuff. The butter chicken's sauce is tasty but with the addition of white meat.. It's not as awesome as it could be with dark meat. While Americans prefer healthy, butter chicken is a dish created to use dark meat. So texturally, breast meat don't work right. And finally their biriyani I find to be decent, but, I'm very picky of biriyani. It seems to be North Indian style. Meat chunks covered in marinade then tossed into rice when it gets plated. Then another heaping spoon of plain basmati tops the biriyani. This to me is not the real deal. Biriyani as a whole should be aromatic. The smells should tantalize you from the moment the dish is revealed. This happens because the rice, the spices, the meat, the marinade is all within a pressure cooker. Cooking for hours, melding flavors together. At the end the chef would give the mixture a few good stirs to blend everything nicely. It's a marriage that any hunger would yearn for. Is their biriyani bad? No, I think most Americans would dig it. But judging costs involved... I think the biriyani could look more like the real deal for the high price tag.

Final thoughts: All in all, take some American friends with you and more than likely everyone will think this is pretty damn good. Their portion sizes compared to pricing is obnoxious. I think it's BYOB.. so do that. If the spiciness of the food is too much order some mango kulfi. It should help with the burn in the sweetest way possible.

Finally, an Indian restaurant with great food and great atmosphere!  Most Indian restaurants look like they have been decorated by someone who is blind but this place while small has a  clean-welcoming-homey feel.  

I so appreciate that management includes both North and South indian dishes on their menu.  This must be in large part to the owner being South Indian.  Word of warning but South Indian dishes overall are spicier than North Indian entrees, which usually are cream based, so if a dish is marked as spicy you better believe them.  That said if your mouth is on fire order anything dairy based like a side of plain yogurt or kulfi (Indian ice cream).  

Love, love, love that Rangoli doesn't drown their paneer dishes with a lot of cream.  You can actually taste the spinach in the palak paneer and the peas in the mutter paneer.  Their butter chicken and chicken tikka masala are perennial faves at our home.  And who doesn't love an entree named after a South Indian stoner song (Kolvari D Saag or Lamb).  

Service has always been on point but in general if we plan on dining in, we avoid the weekend rush or order take out.  Would never use Grubhub for delivery on the weekends during peak hours as Rangoli is always packed during that time and we would be setting ourselves up for a long wait.

 We started off with Kheema Samosas, Chicken 65(excellent, hot!!) and order of butter chicken and Naan with mango lassis for the kiddos. The appetizers pretty much filled us up and we ordered Chicken Chettinad and Lamb biryani for main course with Naan. We shared our table with a group of young Indians(probably the only one with desis) and was a very fun amicable experience. Next time, will skip the mango kulfi, in the words of my 10 year old "its frozen mango lassi" Did i mention the restrooms are maintained very well??

Delicious Indian food. I've had a few places near the loop and this is by far my favorite. Let's jump into what was ordered:

Veggie Somosas - Veggie is the best option. They have a bit of a kick to them so be prepared. 

Garlic Naan and Butter Naan - I would say the Garlic Naan is much more flavorful but I prefer keeping things on the more neutral side to balance well with the paired dishes. 

Paneer Butter Masala - second favorite dish of the night; this is the most friendly dish to those who are not big on spicy foods. The dish has a creamy tomato taste, in its own Indian way. Paneer being cheese, it was right up my alley. 

Aloo Gobi - don't let the lack of chili markings fool you, this dish is so spicy! Easily the spiciest of the night. It's good, but after the second bite I had to move on.

Lamb Korma - yes, order this. There's a vegetarian option if you are vegetarian. Get it. It was the best dish of the night. It had the inviting mildness of the Paneer Butter Masala, but with a more complex flavor profile. Absolutely delicious and highly recommended.

Service - it was fantastic. They are always nice and attentive. We over ordered and noticed our last dish took a little too long to come out. We double checked to see if it was forgotten and as we asked it was ready. However, seeing that we were stuffed to the brink they said they would cancel it rather than make us take it even after we insisted we would honor our order. Very sweet of them!!!

Rangoli, I've loved you for 4 years! But, you're much different now. It's not your fault though, I blame it on the growing popularity for your delicious food! If I could give your food 10 stars, I would. But, 4 years ago you weren't this popular, and you've failed to keep up with demand, and now your service is unacceptable. 

PLEASE! Hire one more person to answer your non-stop-ringing phone for food orders! Or (great idea) open another location! Did you know banks give loans to successful businesses like yours to expand?

I'm not even mad that tonight your to-go lady gave me Lamb Tikka Masala instead of Chicken, because your to-go dishes are labeled so sloppily with 'LTM' or 'CTM', and she couldn't tell the difference. 

PLEASE CLEAN UP YOUR ACT. The best Indian food in Chicago deserves better service.

Have ordered from Rangoli a number of times over past year. Food typically met expectations. Tonight I ordered delivery for 8 people via Grubhub. Delivery time quoted as 75 minutes. When food had not arrived 75 minutes later I called restaurant. No answer. Called again. No answer. Called Grubhub, who called Restaurant. No answer. Called restaurant again, went straight to voicemail. 

Order cancelled via Grubhub and money refunded. I understand restaurants get busy, but I've never had restaurant take an order, not deliver it, and then not answer the phone when I called to inquire of status. Won't be ordering from Rangoli again.

Our favorite Indian restaurant in the city!  We usually do take out but dine in sometimes. The staff is very attentive  and the food is divine. It's a very small place so going early is advised. The Tandoori chicken is so good and the mango chicken is not to be missed. Very good samosas and pekora here too. Enjoy!

My friend and I were at the Garfield Park Conservatory and in search of somewhere to eat for dinner. We did a quick search and Rangoli popped up. We arrived around 7pm on a Wednesday and it was packed! We put our names down and waited about 30 mins. It was a little awkward because there was nowhere to stand and wait except for near the door where a small crowd of people were already standing. We patiently waited for a table to open and when one finally did, we were informed that it was reserved! For such a small restaurant, I don't think it's a good idea to take reservations or at least just have one large table reserved for big groups. While waiting, we looked at the menu and figured out what to order.

We ordered: 
veggie samosas
lamb saag w/basmati rice
mutter paneer
garlic naan

Everything was delicious! The lamb was so tender and the garlic naan was fresh and hot. I had been craving Indian food for awhile and was extremely satisfied with all the dishes. I was stuffed and we still had plenty of leftovers to bring home. 

All the food was reasonably priced. If I lived in the area, I would go there more often or order take out. I want to go back and try their other dishes!

This review is based on one takeout order. 

Based on the favorable reviews, I was super excited to try Rangoli. I phoned ahead and ordered naan, two samosas and chicken tikka masala. The naan, samosas were standard and tasted fine. The disappointment came in the tikka masala because all the chicken pieces were dry. The masala was spot on but had the chicken been cooked better, I would have given Rangoli a fourth star. Loved the interior decor of the restuarant (check out the photos).

I may give it another try but I'm not cruising 32 MPH on a Chicago Speed Zone of 30 MPH to go back.

Veggie Somosas - Veggie is the best option. They have a bit of a kick to them so be prepared. 

Garlic Naan and Butter Naan - I would say the Garlic Naan is much more flavorful but I prefer keeping things on the more neutral side to balance well with the paired dishes. 

Paneer Butter Masala - second favorite dish of the night; this is the most friendly dish to those who are not big on spicy foods. The dish has a creamy tomato taste, in its own Indian way. Paneer being cheese, it was right up my alley. 

Aloo Gobi - don't let the lack of chili markings fool you, this dish is so spicy! Easily the spiciest of the night. It's good, but after the second bite I had to move on.

Lamb Korma - yes, order this. There's a vegetarian option if you are vegetarian. Get it. It was the best dish of the night. It had the inviting mildness of the Paneer Butter Masala, but with a more complex flavor profile. Absolutely delicious and highly recommended.

Service - it was fantastic. They are always nice and attentive. We over ordered and noticed our last dish took a little too long to come out. We double checked to see if it was forgotten and as we asked it was ready. However, seeing that we were stuffed to the brink they said they would cancel it rather than make us take it even after we insisted we would honor our order. Very sweet of them!!!

Rangoli, I've loved you for 4 years! But, you're much different now. It's not your fault though, I blame it on the growing popularity for your delicious food! If I could give your food 10 stars, I would. But, 4 years ago you weren't this popular, and you've failed to keep up with demand, and now your service is unacceptable. 

PLEASE! Hire one more person to answer your non-stop-ringing phone for food orders! Or (great idea) open another location! Did you know banks give loans to successful businesses like yours to expand?

I'm not even mad that tonight your to-go lady gave me Lamb Tikka Masala instead of Chicken, because your to-go dishes are labeled so sloppily with 'LTM' or 'CTM', and she couldn't tell the difference. 

PLEASE CLEAN UP YOUR ACT. The best Indian food in Chicago deserves better service.

Best Indian food in town. The gobi manchurian is amazing. Great for vegetarians as most Indian food usually is. The paneer masala is my favorite. BYOB. Small dining room but worth being packed in there.

Have ordered from Rangoli a number of times over past year. Food typically met expectations. Tonight I ordered delivery for 8 people via Grubhub. Delivery time quoted as 75 minutes. When food had not arrived 75 minutes later I called restaurant. No answer. Called again. No answer. Called Grubhub, who called Restaurant. No answer. Called restaurant again, went straight to voicemail. 

Order cancelled via Grubhub and money refunded. I understand restaurants get busy, but I've never had restaurant take an order, not deliver it, and then not answer the phone when I called to inquire of status. Won't be ordering from Rangoli again.

Our favorite Indian restaurant in the city!  We usually do take out but dine in sometimes. The staff is very attentive  and the food is divine. It's a very small place so going early is advised. The Tandoori chicken is so good and the mango chicken is not to be missed. Very good samosas and pekora here too. Enjoy!

My friend and I were at the Garfield Park Conservatory and in search of somewhere to eat for dinner. We did a quick search and Rangoli popped up. We arrived around 7pm on a Wednesday and it was packed! We put our names down and waited about 30 mins. It was a little awkward because there was nowhere to stand and wait except for near the door where a small crowd of people were already standing. We patiently waited for a table to open and when one finally did, we were informed that it was reserved! For such a small restaurant, I don't think it's a good idea to take reservations or at least just have one large table reserved for big groups. While waiting, we looked at the menu and figured out what to order.

We ordered: 
veggie samosas
lamb saag w/basmati rice
mutter paneer
garlic naan

Everything was delicious! The lamb was so tender and the garlic naan was fresh and hot. I had been craving Indian food for awhile and was extremely satisfied with all the dishes. I was stuffed and we still had plenty of leftovers to bring home. 

All the food was reasonably priced. If I lived in the area, I would go there more often or order take out. I want to go back and try their other dishes!

This review is based on one takeout order. 

Based on the favorable reviews, I was super excited to try Rangoli. I phoned ahead and ordered naan, two samosas and chicken tikka masala. The naan, samosas were standard and tasted fine. The disappointment came in the tikka masala because all the chicken pieces were dry. The masala was spot on but had the chicken been cooked better, I would have given Rangoli a fourth star. Loved the interior decor of the restuarant (check out the photos).

I may give it another try but I'm not cruising 32 MPH on a Chicago Speed Zone of 30 MPH to go back.

My friend from India said skip Devon St and try Rangoli in Wicker Park. It was worth it! Great food, easy price, BYOB. Reminded me of my foody experience in Bangalore this summer. I loved it and my friend said it was very authentic so let's make it a must return visit.

Small, intimate restaurant. They do not take reservations for parties of two. Wait time was about 10 minutes on a Friday evening. Got a table near a ceiling fan (spicy foods makes me sweat). Food was solid and service was great. The chicken was a little dry. The vegetable samosas were ok. The spinach and cheese dish was my favorite.  BYOB is a plus.

After a long day traveling we were excited to rest with a little dinner. We chose this place for delivery. We ordered Chicken Tikka Marsala, Palak Paneer and garlic naan. It was completely tasteless. We spent almost $50 with tip for something we didn't enjoy even a little bit. Never Again. Very disappointing

There are not many Indian food options in the wicker/bucktown area. I just recently moved from San Francisco where it seemed like the Indian was always cheap and good. For some reason all I've been able to find in Chicago has been expensive and just ok. 
This place was exactly that. The food was very authentic and seasoned well but the portions were small and on the pricey side. Still looking for great Indian food in Chicago!

Indian food is a sacred Sunday family tradition for me, and I would break tradition any day of the week so come grab a bite here.

The space is small, so if you're a larger group you may want to travel ahead. If you're a group of two or three, you may end up seated at a table with another group, but that didn't seem to be a problem for anyone.  It's warm, it's cozy. 

We got the following:

Samosas: very flavorful and crispy, not greasy at all. The chutney with it makes it.
Malai Kofta: order two or three or ten million of this dish because it was phenomenal. The perfect balance of slightly sweet and savory. Only wish it had more dumplings in it. 
Chicken Tikka Masala: a staple at every Indian restaurant, it was lovely.
Garlic Naan: my mouth waters for this bread.

Overall this is a really great BYOB Indian spot. The service is a bit slow but the staff is very nice. If this was closer to me I would make this my go-to when ordering take out.

I give the food a 5 star!!!! But the service i give it a 2! The owner/manager has no sense of customer service. I ordered delivery on a Friday and delivery took 2 hrs and my order was missing items. I called 2 times. The first time they said it was 10 min away. 40 min later. The second time i called they told me it had been out for delivery for a while now and should arrive any minute, but i was on the phone when the girl on the phone asked who was going to take my order. They've been rude every single time and I particularly don't like how sneaky they were trying to be. You are busy backed up i get it, but don't tell me my food is 10 min away then its another hour away! I went in to the restaurant for pick up, walked in and manager was rude and had an attitude.

They have good quality food, especially the lamb biryani. I also like Masala Chai. I order online a lot too, they mess up on delivery A LOT, pretty much every time i order, they miss an item, i dont know why, but i have to always wait extra for them to get the 2nd part of my order that was missing. Its kinda ridiculous how they mess up every time with delivery-that is the only reason i am giving a low rating.

Decent appetizers. The quantity of main course dishes they serve is really less even when they're overpriced. Don't taste as good as they look. We expected a lot more. 
It's usually super crowded and the host is rude. 
Instead my suggestion is to visit Cumin, wicker park. 
1 appetizer, 2 main course, 2 naans = $45. Not worth it

This place has gone downhill. They now charge $3 for rice (RICE!) that used to be included with entrees. Also, the portion sizes are significantly smaller than what they used to be, specifically for entrees and the gobi manchurian. Also I don't think that the dishes are as spicy anymore, which was one of the main reasons I liked going here. Last night I ordered the tarka dal - it was almost watered down, much more liquid-y than it had been in the past. Despite the smaller portion, I didn't finish it. 

I won't be going back here anytime soon, and now I need to find another place to put into my local restaurant rotation.

My first time eating at Rangoli was dining in.  The service was subpar as there was one waitress servicing the entire restaurant (approximately 12 tables).  She seemed rushed and ended up forgetting an appetizer that we had ordered.  The food was great however! Their Lamb Vindaloo has some great flavors and serious spice  

When we ordered takeout, the service was good, however the food was not. The lamb vindaloo had not been slow cooked long enough and it was full of chewy fat. 

Overall it's a must try if you live in the neighborhood but I wouldn't put it in the elite class that some do.

I hate to give this place a bad review because generally speaking the food is very good and I like that they are BYOB, BUT I have found staples in my food TWICE when ordering takeout. The first time I thought "Oh, maybe it fell off the bag or something." But the second time it happened I realized that there are way too many unlikely factors that would have to happen for that to be my fault. Maybe it was a coincidence but I don't think I'm willing to risk puncturing my esophagus by going back. I hope that the restaurant sees this and adopts a safer packaging process because I would hate for them to get sued and have to close. Soooo...eat in at this place not takeout!

Too loud, too cramped and the food is either bland or too spicy... I don't see any balance anywhere. 

For the price, it's perhaps a good place if nothing else has any room. 

Samosa felt very stale unfortunately. So did the chicken. 

The platter was 2 parter and they arrived at different times, which was weird in the wrong way. 

Our rice did not reach the table till we were ready to head out and the manager was adamant about billing it. 

Overall, not a good experience.

Best Indian food in the city, in my opinion. I adore this place. We have never had a bad dish. I will continue to come back and continue to recommend this spot. My sister lives down the street and I don't know how she doesn't eat here every single night. 

However, be aware. This place is SMALL, and always very busy. If you order delivery, expect at least an hour wait-- even if you live very close. Best to order ahead and stop in to pick up.

Okay, so I was soo excited to try this place since I've had it on my bookmarked list for quite some time and heard so many good things about it. However, I left thinking, I'm glad I tried it but it was nothing special or amazing. I read that it gets super busy so I decided to check it out on Sunday afternoon for an early dinner right when they open at 4:30pm. Well that was genius since no one was there and we got to pick any table we wanted. They have one table right by the open doors which is nice when the weather is great to catch some Chicago breezes. I mean you know it's about to get hot in your mouth so you need some extra air, right? Right. So upon arrival, the place is very nice decorated with little pillows, funky chandeliers, definitely liked the vibe. The service was good the entire time as everything was brought out fast and served hot just like we like it.

Here is what we got that some people recommended with our friends to share: 
Gobi Manchurian -Cauliflower florets golden fried, saut'eed with chopped garlic, ginger, spring onions, with a hint of soy sauce. Super yummy, my hubby hates cauliflower and loved this dish so it's a must get and get it medium spicy.

Keema Samosa (2pc) Crisp, deep fried turnovers stuffed with mild minced lamb and peas. These were a little dry in my opinion and couldn't really taste the lamb nor the flavor of it.
 
Chicken Tikka Masala- Marinated white meat chicken cooked in tomato based sauce with herbs and spices. Something we get at every Indian restaurant and it did not disappoint. Loved dipping all their fresh naan into it. Oh, and get the butter naan, you'll thank me later.

Vegetable Biryani-Basmati rice and vegetables cooked in aromatic spices; served with raita. Okay, so I didn't love this version as I've had others I liked before. Plus, our curries came with rice already so I wasn't sure why a server didn't let us know before we ordered this as well. 

Lamb Rogan Josh-Boneless lamb cooked with mild dry red chilies with a hint of yogurt. Our server told me to get this dish and he said it's a little spicy. A little spicy?! OMG, it was on fire. I can't tell you my thoughts on this dish since it was basically fire in my mouth and I couldn't taste anything else.

Overall, some classics like tikka masala were awesome, loved the gobi manchurian and of course all their naan, but other dishes were all so eh. I'm really happy we didn't have to wait an hour to sit down because then I would have really been disappointed. Not sure if I'll be back but maybe I would carry out if I was in the area.

This place has the best Indian food I've ever tasted. I'm vegetarian and the options seemed unlimited. I tried the garlic naan dish, the vegetable samosas under the appetizers section, and the dal makhani under the vegetarian dishes section. Just walking past the restaurant had me salivating. The countless spices created an intoxicating aroma. The atmosphere in the restaurant was great for a first date, which is the occasion for why I was there. It's a small venue with intimate seating and dim lighting. The 30 minute wait was totally worth it. The service was quick, and we received ample refills on water to cleanse our palettes from the spicy goodness. I love spicy food, and this place satisfies my love for hot tantalizing dishes. I will definitely come back to try the rest of their menu. 

The only reason I didn't do 5 stars is because we were asked to leave as soon as possible so that a much larger party could sit at our table which was adjacent to the window. I had to chug my beer (BYOB) so I could get out of there quickly.

I was very disappointed with this restaurant. Our waiter was not very helpful at making suggestions. We asked for veggie samosas and we were told they were out of samosas, both vegetarian and meat. We ordered the Bhindi Masala and the Chicken Vindaloo, both were just okay. Nothing special and definitely not worth coming back for. We also ordered the garlic Naan and the regular Naan; again not worth coming back for. We ordered the Basmati rice and the vegetable biryani, the Basmati rice was over cooked, it clumped together and was soggy. The vegetable biryani was extremely dry and had no flavor. The food took a while to come and as we waiting for our food, at the food pass i see 2 samosas magically appearing. I ask a different waiter why we were told there were no more samosas and she said they just arrived. After tasting the samosas i wished they had never arrived. 

The only highlight was the fact that this place is BYOB. I will not be returning.

I will definitely come back to try the rest of their menu. 

The only reason I didn't do 5 stars is because we were asked to leave as soon as possible so that a much larger party could sit at our table which was adjacent to the window. I had to chug my beer (BYOB) so I could get out of there quickly.

I was very disappointed with this restaurant. Our waiter was not very helpful at making suggestions. We asked for veggie samosas and we were told they were out of samosas, both vegetarian and meat. We ordered the Bhindi Masala and the Chicken Vindaloo, both were just okay. Nothing special and definitely not worth coming back for. We also ordered the garlic Naan and the regular Naan; again not worth coming back for. We ordered the Basmati rice and the vegetable biryani, the Basmati rice was over cooked, it clumped together and was soggy. The vegetable biryani was extremely dry and had no flavor. The food took a while to come and as we waiting for our food, at the food pass i see 2 samosas magically appearing. I ask a different waiter why we were told there were no more samosas and she said they just arrived. After tasting the samosas i wished they had never arrived. 

The only highlight was the fact that this place is BYOB. I will not be returning.

I do have a confession to make ,I don't like a whole lot of Indian places in Chi town which I admire so I wasn't expecting this spot to be great either but it turned out to be a pleasant surprise.

During our recent trip we were craving some good Indian food and decided to venture out of downtown area. The location of this area is quite unassuming and there are not a whole lot of eateries around this place.

The place itself is not huge but has some decent seating area , the white wall background with dim lighting added up to the dcor.

They have a menu which is a good mix of traditional Indian and some Indian fusion(Indian Chinese) fare. We decided to try to both , we indulged in -

* Gobi Manchurian - Tender pieces of cauliflower cooked in tangy, sweet and spicy sauce. Cauliflower is coated in a flour layer before tossed in sauces.

* Paneer Masala - Indian cheese cubes cooked in creamy tomato sauce.

* Lamb Biryani - Traditional basmati long rice cooked with curried meat.

* Plain and garlic naan - Bread with butter and garlic flavor.

First the food overall was really good.Gobi Manchurian is a must try it had some really good flavors. The entre paneer dish was also tasty , we wanted little more spice so we got the Indian pickle on side($1 extra). Biryani was also really flavorful and it is recommended to pair it with raita(curd with mix veggies).

It was definitely worth driving from downtown to eat at this restaurant.

Being born and raised in Delhi I know my food very well. Came in for dinner with a few friends and was pleasantly surprised by the food. The dal makhani reminded me of home. Everything on the table was very well prepared. The decor is nice and the byob makes me happy. The breads are made to perfection. It's definitely the best Indian meal I've had in the city. The 2 suggestions I have is to use tender chicken in their preparations. The chicken quality could use some improvement. And secondly the food took forever to come out. Not sure if it was a one off thing and they were understaffed but definitely could use some improvement in that regard too. I'll be returning!!

My Gf and me recently had for that first time indian food couple weeks prior in Minnesota. We were taken away by Chicken Tikka Masala! So we were excited to have it here in Chicago. This place was right in our hood and got good reviews. While the Lamb Saag, Nam Bread was amazing the chicken masala was mehhh.  Really lacking in flavor. Totally disappointed. The service was poor as well. Oddly enough friendly lol but very bad. We had to wave them down for water never checked on us either. Had to wave them down for check. Umm with the crowd waiting you think they would be on point to get us on our way. Also if coming on weekend evening expect a wait with Really no where to wait but really outside.  Ok not sure if will try again. Sill not bad and good ambience

Today is our third weekend in a row ordering from Rangoli. Incredible food; the flavors are amazing! Delivery takes a looong time, but so far it has been worth it. Our favs are the chicken masala, dal makhani and the navratan korma. We've never visited the place, but the delivery has been fantastic.

Rediscovered Rangoli after years and still very impressed! So wish they were located closer! 

We tried the paneer butter masala and it's the real deal! The pav bhaji is as good as ever. The only challenge with this place is how tiny it is! Tables are setup NYC style where you have no privacy in conversation.

Absolutely horrible service. Came in the restaurant and they told us it would have been a 30 min - 1 hour wait to sit down for a table for 2 and so we decided to place an order for pick up. After we put the order in for pickup (and also leaving a 20% tip) they said it would have been a 25 min wait for them to make the food. We left came back 30 min later and there were 3 tables open where people were just coming in an sitting down. We ended up waiting another 15 min at the restaurant while they were working on delivery orders coming in over the ones we placed 45 min before hand. They need a better system, better predictions of when tables will open up, and just common sense. Save yourself the hassle and a potentially ruined evening and go to a place that treats its customers better.

Absolutely delicious, best Indian I've had in Chicago.
This place is a neighborhood gem and it's also BYOB.
The food is incredibly delicious, high quality, and authentic. We had a shrimp dish, a veggie dish and a chicken dish, along with some garlic naan. Everything was devoured. I will definitely be back to try more 

The only down side is that hey don't take reservations for parties of less than 4. Probably because the space is so small. Although it is small inside, we didn't feel cramped at all. This would also be a good place for a date as it is byob, dim lighting, and a casual yet sophisticated atmosphere. Although it may be hard to get a table, as the place does seem to be very popular with the locals. The service during busy times is very slow but only because there are only like 2 waiters. But they are incredibly friendly so we were fine with waiting. 

All in all, 5 stars

We have been coming here since they opened. We have gotten many friends to adopt this place as their go-to Indian food place - above previous Devon Ave favorites. We have taken people who have never had Indian food and now are obsessed. We have taken almost every guest we've had in Chicago. We've recommended the hell out of it to a point it's almost annoying. BUT - we're not going to spread the word anymore. The food is 5 stars. The service is TERRIBLE - 0 stars. That's why they get a "3". It's been bad service for a long time, but it has seemed to hit an all time low. 

The gist - get takeout or delivery (but be prepared to wait awhile for delivery. Takeout is usually way faster and food will be hot).

The service: We went with family in town this week and we were basically ignored. Had to wave hands to get rice and water. It's a small place. It wasn't busy. It's Indian food. Keep the freaking rice and water flowing - not that hard. Also we got a ton of attitude asking about vegan dishes and if they had tea without milk. The getting the check was a whole nother thing. It went from "eh" service but they weren't actually rude, to now rude service with bad attitude. I was happy that they were doing so well and proud to support them and spread the word, but it seems to have gotten to their heads. It was actually offensive it was that bad. I really hope they turn the service around. I think the guy who's usually in front should go to the back. He's solemn, rude at times and generally horrible at his job. The takeout guys in the back are really nice. They should be the servers/greeter. 

Now, to the food. The food is excellent. Perfect for vegetarians, vegans and gluten-free folks (but only if you know what you can eat - be warned they give serious attitude when you ask questions about what it's made with. The Gobi manchurian is the best we've ever had. It's a must. The Pav Bhaji is excellent, but filling if you have a lot of entrees coming for the table.

Entrees. I've had every single vegetarian dish. My favs - the Mushroom Masala, the Vindaloo (love hot stuff - get any of their Vindaloos - I love that they're not afraid to go legit hot for the non-Indian diners, unlike many other places where you get a dumbed-down version), Dal Makhan, Kofta Makhani for a hearty dish and Navratan Korma. Chana Masala is good, but I suggest going for the other dishes. 

My man's favs (he's a meat eater) - Butter Chicken, Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Bagara. 

In the end, the service really leaves a bad taste in your mouth. We will only order takeout from now on. And we're not even sure we will after this last trip. But, honestly, the food is so damn good we probably will. Just less often and we'll stop recommending it to people.

Rangoli was a very pleasant surprise. We went recently to celebrate Diwali, the Indian Festival of Lights, symbolizing good wins over evil. I give it 4 stars and not 5 only because the food was 'super HOT' aka chilly hot, not the temperature. My wife can't handle a lot of heat but by the end of it, she too had watery eyes and needed yogurt to cool her palette. Please emphasize the level of heat in advance. 

Even with Diwali, we were able to secure a reservation the same day for 5 of us. *star*

BYOB - *star*

Food - we ordered yellow lentils with goat, chicken chettinad, chicken tikka masala, assorted Bread, the shrimp appetizer, and tandoori chicken. Everything was flavorful and the taste varies from dish to dish. We also got some gulab jamun and mango kulfi for dessert. *star

Value & Service - the restaurant was very busy but service was fast. Everything came out timely. The bill for all our food with tip and tax was $100. *star*

The food here is really good but delivery is terrible. They usually estimate over a hour for delivery which is fine when given upfront, but then routinely miss that mark-- last night I ordered at 6:30pm and didn't receive my food until around 9:00. If you're going to offer delivery through websites like GrubHub please make sure you have the capacity to fulfill those orders within your estimated window!!

I finally made it to Rangoli! I heard a lot about this amazing restaurant from reviews and articles about it online. I myself am Indian and have been eating and going to Devon Street since before I could walk. If my family, friends or I ever wanted authentic, no bullshit Indian food, we would go to our favorite places there. I think it's great that Rangoli is located in a different area so people don't have to drive all the way up north to Devon to get quality Indian food. 

When I looked at their menu online, I nearly screamed and jumped out of my seat when I saw that they serve gobi manchurian! (DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and order this if you haven't already!) The last time I had this was when I was visiting family in India and I haven't been able to find it anywhere in Chicago since then. Its a Chinese/Indian fusion cauliflower appetizer and beyond that I can't describe it too much - you just gotta try it. They make it so well that I feel like I am in India eating it. 

My friend ordered a mango lassi which I tried and it was the perfect consistency and not too sweet. Awesome! We also ordered gobi manchurian, veggie samosa, naan, butter paneer and rice. The entire meal was incredible. This tastes like homemade food. Take it from a caramel sista!

My husband had heard great things about Rangoli so we tried take out one Sunday night. The food unfortunately was disappointing. The chicken tikka masala was just okay and nothing special compared to other Indian restaurants. The palak paneer was watered down with not much flavor. And the lamb biriyani had pockets of spice and flavor because the spices weren't completed mixed together entirely. Additionally, 30 minutes after I put in my order, I received a call from the restaurant saying they were out of the gobi manchurian and would provide me a refund for it. It's been almost a month and I've yet to receive that refund. Needless to say, we will not be ordering Rangoli from again.

I do Indian food about as often as I watch Bollywood films, but I'd consider Rangoli the Slumdog Millionaire for my stomach cause it was definitely some feel good food for the summer. 

Get the Gobi Manchurian. It's basically orange chicken except with cauliflower instead of meat and the garlic naan is good to start as well. For entrees, either the Mushroom Masala, Lamb Rogan Josh, or Lamb Korma are all amazing options and none of them gave me indigestion either which is usually not the case when I dabble in this cuisine. 

They do lots of deliveries, but it's a great place to dine in on the account of the lavish dcor, being BYOB, and the incredibly attentive service. It was a really nice touch that they kept coming up to make sure things weren't too spicy. They must have sensed my stomach is usually sensitive to the spices, and it was very comforting to see they cared bout what the aftermath of the meal might be for me. 

Overall it was an excellent experience. If you're not into heading all the way up to Devon for awesome Indian food Rangoli is a really good option without the hike up north.

For entrees, either the Mushroom Masala, Lamb Rogan Josh, or Lamb Korma are all amazing options and none of them gave me indigestion either which is usually not the case when I dabble in this cuisine. 

They do lots of deliveries, but it's a great place to dine in on the account of the lavish dcor, being BYOB, and the incredibly attentive service. It was a really nice touch that they kept coming up to make sure things weren't too spicy. They must have sensed my stomach is usually sensitive to the spices, and it was very comforting to see they cared bout what the aftermath of the meal might be for me. 

Overall it was an excellent experience. If you're not into heading all the way up to Devon for awesome Indian food Rangoli is a really good option without the hike up north.

Amazing spot! Some of the servers can be grouchy, but who cares- the Gobi Manchurian and the Mango Chicken are 100% worth it. If you can, grab a front table- the open the windows during the summer for a lovely dining al fresco experience.

I'm saddened I had such a bad experience w this place today.  I have always had positive experiences here and tonight they completely let me down.  We ordered food cause we didn't have a car to get there like we usually do, we ordered at 5:50, food arrived at 7;35, we live 1.5 miles away but rain and no car we opted for delivery.   When the food finally arrives it was the wrong spice level, we couldn't eat it.  I called back and they said they would give me a full refund, instead, they refunded the 2 entrees and still charged me the tax, delivery and kept the credit card tip on my one piece of naan.   I was shocked.  I'm still shocked, that was terrible customer service.  I won't be returning to what was my favorite place.   Beware of delivery , they don't guarantee the quality of the food.

My only complaint is the portion sizes, I swear take-out is half the size as dine-in.   I just want them to give me more  than 5 pieces of chicken in my "chicken" tiki masala.  Felt like a sample sized portion.  Order a bunch of different stuff if your trying to feed a group.

Not a fan. I try to rate places for what they intend to be and I didn't understand the hype. Food was average at best - very mild spice level. I couldn't pinpoint it but something about the flavors and textures of pretty much everything seemed off. I have tried a lot of Indian food as it's a favorite of mine, but this seemed like an Americanized version. Service was pleasant enough - polite but nothing more. Go to Devon. Better food, better service at comparable prices. I don't care if this is the trendy Wicker Park/West Town spot. Not worth the time.

Meh. Pretty boring, flavor lacking possibly bc they charge for chutney. We didn't get any bc they already charged us 3$ extra for rice. For an entre at 14$, just give us the white rice.

This is the best and one of the few BYOB restaurants for Indian cuisine in the city. Absolutely love the place! I've been here thrice already in the past one year. If you like spicy and hot, then this should be your go to Indian restaurant.The menu is not a traditional "chicken tikka masala" menu but offers dishes from all over India. The Gobhi (cauliflower) Manchurian ( Indo-Chinese) Chicken Chettinad (South Indian) and Lamb Vindaloo (Goan) are my favorite!

Loved it!! 

Food was great - not the absolute best overall Indian food I've ever had, but it was close! One of the vegetable curries we tried (had pineapple in it) was one of the best veg dishes I've had in recent memory. What really made our experience great though was the service. When we ordered the lamb vindaloo (which had 3 chilis next to it), the server cautioned us about its spiciness, so we we asked for it to be medium spicy instead. Even with that adjustment, it was ridiculously hot to our weakling palates. Our server and a guy who I think might have been a manager kept their eyes on us, checked in to make sure it wasn't *too* spicy, and then kept our water re-filled and gave us a cooling yogurt sauce when they saw that clearly it was. I really appreciated their level of consideration and desire to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.

Will definitely be back!

The service was so-so, but it doesn't even matter. The food is delicious and the decor is gorgeous. I came here with a few girlfriends on a Wednesday night around 7, and it was pretty crowded. We didn't have to wait, but the few groups behind us did. So I would expect to wait or come at an off time. We had the malai kofta, chicken tikka masala, and the madras lamb korma. Everything was fantastic.

First, eta was for 1.5 hours - but that was only communicated after charging me and sending the receipt to my email. and some how after 2 full hours the food isn't here. After calling 5+ times and getting voicemail, they finally responded to say "they found my order" but with no further explanation.

My husband I came on a Friday night after feeling cooped up in the house.  Rangoli is small but cozy, fragrant, and the decorations are very nice.  We got there just before the dinner rush and were seated after a short wait.  The tables turn over at a good pace here.  

The food is spicy!! Even the medium spicy is SPICY!  We have a fairly tolerant spice level but definitely are not spicy eating pros.   The gobi mancurian was delicious!! We asked for a recommendation for the lamb entrees a the Lamb Rogan Josh was suggested as it would be medium spicy.  Except that it was extremely spicy, but the meat was cooked well, tender and juicy and the flavor was delicious.  We asked for an order of Raita to help with the spiciness, which they did not charge us for. Navratan Korma  sauce was very good however the vegetables in side were cut in huge chunks and were under-cooked.  

The prices are set very reasonably.  The service was very attentive. 

I must mention that our favorite Indian restaurant is Cumin and it probably still is even after a wonderful evening at Rangoli.

My only grievance is that they don't take reservations. 

If you go on a Friday or Saturday evening be prepared to WAIT! I was told around 30 minutes and it was more like an 1 hour and 30 minutes.  

The food is delicious though and very fresh which is why I keep going back despite the horrible wait times. 

I was able to find the tandoori chicken on their appetizer menu which seems to be the only grilled chicken item on the menu. Really good food and once you're seated it's good service too! I'll definitely go back, just not during their Saturday night stampede.

This is an excellent Indian food option if you don't want to head to Devon, or are tired of nearby Cumin.

I'm a big fan of Chicken 65 and their version here is fantastic. All the usual suspects like veggie samosas and chutneys are made in-house and are delicious (helloooo tamarind chutney, I want to bottle you up and take you home).

Word to the wise, they do not joke around with their spice level.

Went last night with a few family members and we ordered a ton!

Appetizer:
Keema Samosas: A little dry, but with the chutneys this was delicious! There was more dough than I would prefer, but it was still good.

Main Dishes:
Lamb Rogan Josh: Not as soft as I would like it. Those who usually like this type of dish enjoyed it though.

Kadai Chicken: Yum! Flavorful and would definitely order again.

Mutter Paneer: GET THIS! If you don't usually like mutter paneer, you still need to try this. It is the best mutter paneer I've probably ever had. I love that the paneer pieces were smaller too so I could get a piece with each bite.

Butter Chicken/Chicken Tikka Masala: We got both dishes, but couldn't tell the difference between the flavors of each. The flavors were still amazing and butter chicken is a staple at every indian restaurant, so I would still get it.

Also, their garlic naan is soft and has a ton of garlic...which is a good thing!

Horrible place and staff--
Place is too congested... we had to wait for 45 mins to get a place for 2.

Now come to food- we wanted to have a decently spiced and tasty chicken dishes.. server recommended to go with Chicken Haryali. The ingredients looked promising as it had chilies, coconut milk, mint, coriander and other SPICES ( not only chillies). We also ordered chicken biryani as it's another authentic Indian dish.

When food came it was tasting horrible... but dishes had only one thing in common- taste of Chillies and nothing else!! 

We had to order a bowl of curd to gulp the food down! When I complained to the staff... they rudely expressed that that's "how these dishes taste". They were very arrogant for some reasons( maybe not willing to listen). Also there was no manager present during the busy hours! 

I would advise People to complain and put honest reviews if they also have faced the same...they are not selling authentic Indian food. Very disappointing experience

Rangoli got it going on. 

Rangoli has surpassed my expectations every time. I've been here with friends, family and even hosted my hubby's surprise 30th bday party. For the party, the staff let me bring a cake beforehand, decorate the table with corny bday crap and when his fam rolled up with coolers to BYOB (which is why I love them), they didn't even bat an eye. 

Their food is phenomenal. Something that stands out here is the gobi manchurian which I always get. It tastes like calamari but it's cauliflower. How the f? I've had the samosas, naan, roti, tikka, the kofta which were all excellent. Recently I said yolo and tried the navratan korma, which was sweet and peanuty and a beautiful break from spicy food when you need it. Hubby loves the lamb korma and pretty much every lamb dish here. Every time I've been, I've shut the place down and they've never said a thing. Truly the nicest staff ever!

I love Rangoli forever ever.

Eating Rangoli is like eating a hug. It is that good and it makes me that happy.

I live near here and usually get takeout, because if you want to BYOB it and eat at Rangoli, you must eat EARLY in the evening; this place gets packed! When I did dine-in, the experience was lovely and the service spot-on. I was not familiar with Indian food and the waiter gave us great suggestions from spicy veggie dishes to delectable meat entrees. 

Now that I am more of a Rangoli regular, I always always order the same thing: Chicken Tikka Masala. It is so so so so delicious. I crave it. For an appetizer, I always must get the Gobi Manchurian. It. Is. Heaven.

Rangoli is a Humboldt Park destination spot that everyone must try. If you like happiness, you will love Rangoli.

Great Indian restaurant.  The place is wonderfully decorated and service was great.

But more importantly the food was fantastic.  Get the gobi manchurian as a starter.  The lamb korma was something I have never had at any Indian restaurant and was delicious.  For vegetarians get the dal makhani.

My friend Matt recommended the Chicken 65 but he doesn't know S....

This place is as good or better than any Indian place on Devon.  The only difference is the Devon restaurants portion sizes are bigger than this restaurant.

Having grown up on a steady daily dose of Indian food, the food is legit and the service is above average (for Indian places), but serving sizes are small and the food is a few dollars overpriced, but then again it's also BYOB. The food isn't the absolute best, but for what it is, it's great.

Horrible place and staff--
Place is too congested... we had to wait for 45 mins to get a place for 2.

Now come to food- we wanted to have a decently spiced and tasty chicken dishes.. server recommended to go with Chicken Haryali. The ingredients looked promising as it had chilies, coconut milk, mint, coriander and other SPICES ( not only chillies). We also ordered chicken biryani as it's another authentic Indian dish.

When food came it was tasting horrible... but dishes had only one thing in common- taste of Chillies and nothing else!! 

We had to order a bowl of curd to gulp the food down! When I complained to the staff... they rudely expressed that that's "how these dishes taste". They were very arrogant for some reasons( maybe not willing to listen). Also there was no manager present during the busy hours! 

I would advise People to complain and put honest reviews if they also have faced the same...they are not selling authentic Indian food. Very disappointing experience

Rangoli got it going on. 

Rangoli has surpassed my expectations every time. I've been here with friends, family and even hosted my hubby's surprise 30th bday party. For the party, the staff let me bring a cake beforehand, decorate the table with corny bday crap and when his fam rolled up with coolers to BYOB (which is why I love them), they didn't even bat an eye. 

Their food is phenomenal. Something that stands out here is the gobi manchurian which I always get. It tastes like calamari but it's cauliflower. How the f? I've had the samosas, naan, roti, tikka, the kofta which were all excellent. Recently I said yolo and tried the navratan korma, which was sweet and peanuty and a beautiful break from spicy food when you need it. Hubby loves the lamb korma and pretty much every lamb dish here. Every time I've been, I've shut the place down and they've never said a thing. Truly the nicest staff ever!

I love Rangoli forever ever.

Eating Rangoli is like eating a hug. It is that good and it makes me that happy.

I live near here and usually get takeout, because if you want to BYOB it and eat at Rangoli, you must eat EARLY in the evening; this place gets packed! When I did dine-in, the experience was lovely and the service spot-on. I was not familiar with Indian food and the waiter gave us great suggestions from spicy veggie dishes to delectable meat entrees. 

Now that I am more of a Rangoli regular, I always always order the same thing: Chicken Tikka Masala. It is so so so so delicious. I crave it. For an appetizer, I always must get the Gobi Manchurian. It. Is. Heaven.

Rangoli is a Humboldt Park destination spot that everyone must try. If you like happiness, you will love Rangoli.

Great Indian restaurant.  The place is wonderfully decorated and service was great.

But more importantly the food was fantastic.  Get the gobi manchurian as a starter.  The lamb korma was something I have never had at any Indian restaurant and was delicious.  For vegetarians get the dal makhani.

My friend Matt recommended the Chicken 65 but he doesn't know S....

This place is as good or better than any Indian place on Devon.  The only difference is the Devon restaurants portion sizes are bigger than this restaurant.

Having grown up on a steady daily dose of Indian food, the food is legit and the service is above average (for Indian places), but serving sizes are small and the food is a few dollars overpriced, but then again it's also BYOB. The food isn't the absolute best, but for what it is, it's great.

I primarily only go out to eat my Indian food on Devon Avenue- glad to have a closer excellent option - we had a big group and everyone thought the place was top notch. Keep in mind, there is no reason to ask for their "spicy" version of their dishes because there is plenty of spice.  Everyone agreed it was at the top end of the bearable spicy level which is perfect.  Must gets are the Gobi Manchurian app, the chicken tikka, the channas, and shrimp vindaloo (real spicy), and make sure to leave room for the mango kulfi - best kulfi I have had outside of India.  We ate like kings multiple apps, many main dishes, rice and endless naans, and desert and the bill was only $22 a head which included tip - crazy cheap for that quality

5 stars! The atmosphere is relaxed yet perfect for a date night or dinner with friends. I would recommend the Malai Kofta if you want to try something new and the chicken tikki masala was also fantastic. 

I am so glad we stopped in - Rangoli is a little hidden Indian gem in Humbolt Park.

I had heard that Rangoli opened at 4:30pm and that there was often a wait, so we went at 5 and were sat immediately.

The first thing I absolutely HATED was that they had two person tables for three people. This was ridiculously uncomfortable. Imagine a booth/chair set-up, but all of their booth sides had two plates at each table. There was no way that adults could sit here comfortably. I know it's because of the small space, but it's really degrading to the dining experience.

I have to take off a full-star for this cheap set-up.

As for the menu, it's classic Indian fare, which I love. They had a lot of staples there with a range between mild and super spicy. We kicked it off with the Gobi Manchurian. It's basically a garlicky, saucy, cauliflower appetizer. It was a little spicy, but not bad. It was a decent sized portion for three people.

Then, we ordered Palak Paneer, Mutter Paneer, Malai Kofta, and Garlic Naan. It was served with a plate of basmati rice. It was all really delicious, but I have had better Palak Paneer. I couldn't really put my finger on what I didn't like about it, but I know I have had other palak paneer that I like better.

All in all, it was pretty good. Our bill came to be about $60. I felt we were getting rushed out the door for most of our meal, but they were pretty busy when we were leaving.

This is a great place to eat and if the seating had been comfortable, easily 4 stars for food, but the seating was just too cramped.

Just a word of caution, if you don't like your food super spicy, don't eat here.  Generally, I really enjoy spicy food, but I couldn't get through my meal.  Just to give a scale of how hot it was, eat some raw habanero peppers whole, and you'll experience a similar sensation.  I ordered delivery from grub hub and selected medium spicy for my dish and my girlfriend asked for mild for hers.  We typed in special instructions for her dish and it was still very spicy.  We called to let the business know how we couldn't enjoy their food because it was too spicy.  Instead of listening to our feedback and making it right, they made us feel as if we were being unreasonable.  If you enjoy food that challenges you, this is your place, if you don't, steer clear.

So I took the wifey here to get some great Indian food in hopes it would induce her into giving birth. We went with two friends (a couple) who also love Indian food. Ever since I moved to Chicago from London four years ago, I have been searching for Indian that held up anywhere close to the lovely dishes found in the UK capital. Well with Rangoli, I have finally found it. And best of all it is BYOB.

We always start off with samosas here. They have two different type: lamb and veg. There are two samosas in each order and are huge. Not large but huge, like the size of genetically modified tomatoes big. We also started off with gobi manchurian, which is like Indian orange chicken. I think next time, I will order a different app. It was ok but not outstanding.

We ordered two mains: butter chicken and vindaloo lamb. They come in small bowls. When the dishes arrived, I thought they were very small, but as always, my eyes were larger than my stomach. The mains come with rice which they attentatively refill. We ordered two garlic naan which were great too. The two mains were great. The vindaloo sooooo spicy, which my friend really liked as well as the wifey. My wife and I also ordered two mango lassi.

All in, this place has secured it space on our restaurant shelf for the regular rotation.

I came here on a Saturday night for a birthday party, we had a group of 16.  So they do take reservations and they do accommodate large groups, however, our large party did dominate the restaurant.

The place is BYOB without corkage fee.

I thought the food was good. I'm not an expert in traditional Indian food. Myself and my whole party enjoyed their food. The service was good.

I'd come again.

It was truly one of the coldest nights in Chicago and the boy wanted something different, so he picked Indian via Grub Hub. I didn't realize until after we had ordered, that it's right across the street! We were quoted an hour for our food around 8PM on a Friday night, but we got it in about 30-40 minutes. When the boy came to pick it up, he said the restaurant was packed so I was surprised to receive our food so quickly.

The food was delicious. We ordered Lamb Rogan Josh (absolutely loved the sauce but the lamb was a bit tough), Shrimp Masala (preferred the lamb, spicier than the lamb although both were ordered as medium spicy?), Garlic Naan (delicious and almost twice the size of my face!) and Gobi Manchurian appetizer (wasn't as crunchy/crispy as I would have liked but since it was boxed up, I understand. Delicious appetizer with a similar texture of sweet and sour pork).

I haven't had Indian food in quite a while, so I was already excited for dinner. But everything was truly awesome. I can't wait to order from them again or even better, bring my own bottle of wine (since it's BYOB) and walk across the street!

So far... the best Indian food in Chicago! and it's BYOB.

We ordered:
Butter Chicken(Chicken Makhani): so good, fresh, creamy and flavorful(my favorite!)
The Garlic Naan: fresh and soft. 
Shrimp Vindaloo: good but might be TOO spicy for some. 
Chicken Tikka(appetizer): moist, tender and flavorful!

Only complaint is that wish their service was little more friendly. 

Overall, the food was great! It's great to have a decent Indian place to go in a neighborhood. 
We will definately be going back!

What a cool little place to eat some Indian food!! I'm a fan of Indian food and was pretty hungry running errands in the city. The place is clean and the service is fast and great. 

The person helping me could tell that my husband and I were new to the place, so she really helped us out by showing us how's it's done at NAANSENSE! Haha I love the name.

The food is delicious!!! And the price is right. For two people and bottle water, we spent around $20 bucks, so not too bad for a lunch out in the city. 

Enjoy

I describe this place to my friends as the Indian Chipotle (no pun intended), but i think this place is one step above that. I really like their food, it is a good and interesting spot for lunch every once in a while. I would give one more star if the portions were a little more generous or if the price was a little lower. The food does have plenty of flavor and i do get the sense of freshness in their food.  

I have had the lamb, chicken, rice and all the side veggies with the coconut sauce. All were great. I also tried the samosa and it was great. My only disappointment was the naan (ironic)...it was dens and flat...not something you would imagine fresh out of the oven (they can improve there)

They hired good staff there. The kind of people I trust to make my food.

Naansense is one of my go-to spots for lunch. It caters to a variety of dietary needs (can't have dairy) so I appreciate it that.

Atmosphere- Solid, casual. "Happening" spot for lunch as there are often long lines.
Service- It's a lot like Chipotle so it's quick service (even the line goes by quickly).
Food- The food is great! Portions are very generous (I always get full). I tend to get a bowl with chicken tikka/chickpeas but I think it's pretty tough to go wrong here.

Highly recommend this spot, especially if you're looking for a quick (and good) spot for lunch!

Thanks Naansense for attending the "Order the Yelp" kick off so I could find out about you! and an even bigger thanks for providing the $1 taco coupons cause I love saving money.

This place gets crowded during lunch time.. like the line is consistently 10-15 people deep. But no fear! They cater to the working M-F crowd so they know how to keep the line moving and the food coming. Definitely got that assembly line on point.

It's simple, you go in, pick what kind of dish you want (taco, bowl, or naanwich aka wrap) and then you go pick and choose your proteins and toppings. I got the lamb and chicken taco! Really liked them both :) And because of the coupon, they were only $2 as opposed to $7!! So awesome. 

My only sad note is that they don't have plates and silverware for those dining in. Yeah I know it's catered to the busy working people in the loop who need their food to-go but I wish it was just a little more environmentally friendly by providing the option to eat in and not waste to-go containers. Cause I ate in, finished my delicious 2 tacos, and had to throw away my container :(

Came here for 'Order the Yelp' and found half of the staff rude and half helpful, some of the food flavorful and some of it over seasoned, and the total portion size meager. 

The guy at the counter (Abel A) didn't know what the 'Order The Yelp' deal was- the ticket said 'Chicken Tiikka Bowl' - and I tried to ask him for help and see what I could get instead, but he was fighting me he whole way, refusing to help, giving me an attitude, and even throwing away a bowl he had started making for me when I pointed out that they had the ingredients for making a 'chicken tikka bowl' (eye roll from him included that time).  I started to get frustrated with him, so I was very thankful when the girl behind the counter took over for him. He left for the kitchen and I didn't see him again. 

The girl politely finished dressing my bowl and gave me a bag of chips for the trouble caused (she was all smiles as we left) and I was relieved she came to my aid!

The Chicken Tikka Bowl had rice, tikka sauce and chopped chicken, diced cucumbers, and pickled onions. The menu listed the savory tomato tikka as Mild, but it was salty & very hot. I love spicy food, but I was looking for mild and masterly, and this was Not The One! Since I mixed everything together, the whole dish was ruined for me. Plus, the 'bowl' was less than half full- so for the price of $7 it didn't seem like a deal for me. I would not pay full price for 1/2 a bowl of food.

Complete Nonsense.

How can you not love this spot?

No, seriously, I'm asking, because I've only had incredible food here. And it's quick. And it's cheap. And it's delicious.

It's sort of a Chipotle for Indian food type of thing, where you go down the line, make your meal and come away with exactly what you want. Spicy or sweet, what type of rice or naan, so good. 

Plus, I love that they make their own naan in the back in a stone naan maker. No freeze-dried nonsense here, all excellent real fresh Naansense. 

I've come a bunch of times for a fast lunch and always walked out happy. Always. No question.

Like so many other people, I was a little hesitant on how this Indian chipotle was going to work.  Well it does, my friend and I'm disappointed in myself for not coming sooner.  It's obviously not super hardcore Indian street food, because let's face it, we're in the Loop.  But it's really fresh, well-made food that gives Indian food lovers the familiar seasonings and flavors that we love so much.

I got the rice bowl with chicken and all the vegetables with like a half cup of their spicy red sauce.  So let me just say that I'm a huge fan of their spicy sauce.  Trump: "HUGE!"  Also, extra brownie points for all of the employees being super chill and not rushing the guests or being stingy with the sauces.  The chicken was incredibly tender and the whole meal tasted pretty healthy for the most part.  The masala fries not so much though.  But it was so crispy and I think may even be better than Benjyehuda's fries.  And for some reason their mustard sauce pairs so well with the fries.  Naansense? More like Nom Nom Sense!  hahaha!  Anyone?

Good fast-casual lunch place. The chicken is flavorful and not dry. I liked the fresh cheese too, but was a little on the dry side. The Coconut sauce and the cashew ginger were tasty. The tacos are a good portion. Each taco is probably 6-7 inches long and pretty filled. 

Definitely check out if you work in the loop.

Really great lunch at Naansense! It was not too busy when I arrived, but the line grew during the time I ate my meal. However, it seemed to be moving quickly.

I enjoyed a rice bowl with chicken and the spiced coconut sauce. The sauce was listed as medium but wasn't too spicy. The portion was very generous. I loved that a little salad and a piece of naan were included. For the salad, I asked for the spicy dressing on the side. It was SPICY and I like spice, so be careful! I wish I asked for another dressing as well because it was too much for me to use liberally.

Definitely worth the price!

The service has improved immensley. I even saw the rude cashier a few more times and she was a lot nicer. Some girl on the food line with pink in her hair was rude and seemed annoyed bc I wanted extra veggies. The customer service here is so wishy-washy. The older staff from like 6 months ago was amazing. Oh well.

My problem is with the food quality, though. I thought I'd come back after a yelp event bc I met the owner and he was really nice and gave out $1 taco cards.

The tacos were borderline gross. After they made my food, I sat down right away to eat and the naan was super soggy and fell apart. Their quality of veggies aren't good. They're soggy, wet, and mushy .. so when you put that on break or naan or anything all the liquid seeps in and it's just a disaster. I threw my food away.

The fries are always amazing as long as they don't give you old ones. The dipping sauce is delish. I would only come back for the fries, and never for anything else. So sad.

Okay, updating my review because the woman taking my order today was so much sweeter and more pleasant than person who served me the last time. I ordered a vegetarian bowl because I'm still hesitant about their meats. Great portions and the sauces are decent but nothing amazing. I like their assortment of roasted veggies (squash, carrots, cauliflower, onion) and unlike the roasted veggies at other fast food establishments (roti etc) these veggies are fresh and not laden with oil.

Also, today's naan was much better than the last time. I think they must have stopped using basically white pizza dough.

Having a somewhat serious sodium allergy and overall disagreement with bountiful amounts of salt added to foods and its unhealthy attributes, I wasn't charmed by a place that boasts, everything from the rice to the veggie's has a lot of salt. In other words, we gut load all our items except water with copious amounts from the ever loving salt shaker because why? No reason, they just do. Taking the healthy out of what could be a decent meal left me thirsty after concluding that their rice and veggies would taste like fresh and delicious veggies and rice without all that salt.

I was craving Indian food (or something close to it), so I decided to check this place out for lunch. The setup is very similar to Chipotle or Naf Naf. 

I ordered a chicken rice bowl and was impressed by the portion size. The savory tomato/tikka sauce was pretty tasty as well. 

My only criticism would be that the naan wasn't very good - not a great texture and very white bread. That said, I'll still happily go back for the chicken tikka.

Naansense: The Indian Chipotle to quench your craving for Indian food.

Probably the 100th person on here to compare this to Chipotle but there no better comparison. Naansense is pretty much Indian-like cuisine in a fast food layout. Just like you don't go to Chipotle for Mexican food, I wouldn't come here for 'proper' Indian food. However, the items they have here have all the right combination of spices to satisfy your craving for Indian food. 

On my one visit here, I ordered a chicken rice bowl with the red chili and savory tomato sauces with cool garlic topping. The naan bread that comes with the rice bowl was disappointing, which is surprisingly for a place called 'Naan'-sense. It was cold and almost not properly cooked. I definitely enjoyed the bowl, much more than the naan, and thought it was quite filling. For the amount and quality of food, it is reasonably priced. The service was great: friendly and prompt. I would definitely come back if I was in the area and wanted something quick and filling.

I love my job! Because I get to take part in FREE catered lunches from restaurants that wants my company's business when ordering for business meetings; Naansense was a restaurant that visited my office this past Tuesday & I'm so glad they did!

What I loved about this restaurant is that their mission is to demystify Indian cuisine and they start with 4 sauces that all delicious! Tomato, Cashew Ginger, Spicy Coconut, & Red Chili then you create your own meal with the chicken, rice, naan bread, cucumber salad & other options. It was so good, I went back for seconds!

& as I'm typing this review, it's making me want to have it for lunch tomorrow & since  it's right down the street I think I will!

I was really excited to try this place because I enjoyed Bombay Wraps.  I went in about a half hour before closing and the person who took my order was incredibly unpleasant.  She informed me they would be closing in "a few minutes" when I said we would dine in even though it was more like 30-40 minutes.  They were somehow out of both brown and basmati rice, so I can't comment on the bowls.  They were also out of one of their 4 sauces.  The naan didn't have a hint of authenticity and the vegetables were soggy.  

The masala fries were good and the tikka sauce was good.   The food was mediocre and the service was almost hostile -- I don't think I'll return.

After searching for an Indian place close to work, I found Naansense online, and based on the reviews I read, I felt comfortable ordering from here, sight unseen. 

I ordered a Chicken rice bowl. For the bowls, you have your choice of several protein or vegetable options, then you choose your rice, sauce, and an optional topping. I tried the "cool garlic yogurt chutney" on top, and the whole combination was fabulous! What I particularly liked was that they thoughtfully put the sauce in a separate cup, and even wrapped it with plastic wrap so it wouldn't spill before I got it back to my office. The portion size was perfect for lunch and it was very tasty.

I also had an order of the chicken samosas, and those were up there with my favorites from other Indian places. The sauces they provide were good too. There's not much to the place; in fact it's rather small, yet it was crowded with every table taken, so I'm thinking others like it as well. The rest of the menu is limited, yet they've obviously mastered what they offer. And I found what I like...and I enjoyed it! So I'll be happy to add Naansense into my lunchtime rotation when I order out.

Chipotle for Indian food...brilliant! 

It's quick, it's tasty, and it's cheap! What more could you ask for? Well worth the Dheli belly you will inevitably be left with after stuffing yourself at Naansense.

I had a hankering for Indo/Pak food for lunch so I decided to give Naansense a try. Knowing this was not "true" Indian/Pakistani cuisine you'd get on Devon, my expectations were tempered. 

I walk in and the place was busy and smelled great! There were signs on the wall showing you how to order, very helpful. I got a rice bowl w/chicken and was advised that mixing the 2 hotter sauces would be awesome. Then I got all the veggies and was recommended to get squirts of 2 sauces. And it comes with a small piece of naan. Order was to go.

The verdict: I was BLOWN AWAY. The best way to describe my Naansense experience was every bite had a wonderful burst of flavors. The freshness of all the veggies in taste and crunch was very notable. The interplay of spicy, then sweet, then fragrant, and a little tart simply put a smile on my face. They are to Indo/Pak food like what Chipotle is to Mexican. And I mean that in a very good way.   

Oh man how'd I miss you Naansense after all these years, just around the block from my office? I'm so sorry. It will be my TGIF Friday treat going forward!

This place is my favorite place for lunch! If you have a restricted diet, but don't want to shell out more than $10 for a filling lunch, this is the place!!!! Gluten free and vegan options are clearly labeled so ordering within your diet is super easy and it is ALL. SO. DELICIOUS. I could literally drink the Spiced Coconut Madras sauce they have. If they sold it in jars I would buy 7. On top of the great food, the people that work there are the nicest on the planet! Seriously, if you live around/work in the loop, go here! If they sold breakfast, I'd never leave.

It's good, but honestly I prefer Roti. Nothing bad against Naansense, I just feel like there isn't as much variety in flavors in comparison to Roti. But my fresh veggie naanwich was delicious. That cashew ginger sauce was something else but I will say the fries weren't that appetizing. Also my naanwich completely fell apart as soon as I got a hold of it. Not what I want with my food. Still yummy though.

Another dish I had from Naansense was the chicken salad bowl, filled with fresh grilled chicken (very flavorful and tender bits of chicken), lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Topped off with a lovely chimichurri sauce and a piece of naan on the side, it was a nice healthy meal to get away from all of that fattening food that's out there in this world.

I was visiting Chicago on business. I am really into hot and spicy food so of course Indian cuisine is high on my list of favorites. I Googled hot and spicy food in Chicago and came up with this article:

https://www.thrillist.com/eat/chicago/spiciest-dishes-in-chicago-best-spicy-food

Despite the description at the article, I found Naansense to be standard Indian fare. The vindaloo was spicy but not "face-melting" nor would any hardcore heat addict like me find it even remotely challenging. 

If hot and spicy is your thing, look elsewhere.

I get food delivered from this place all the time via Doordash. The potato samosas are my absolute favorite thing on the menu. I'm not an Indian food aficionado by any means, but the tasty options I've had so far -- an the delicious sauces that come with each dish -- encourage me to be more adventurous with my menu choices. 

I usually get a bowl - either the chicken tikka or the veggie one -- and a few samosas. I'm also not sure which of the sauces go with which menu item buuuut... everything pretty much tastes good with everything! Each meal comes with a slice of naan to help mellow out the spicier options, and it is quite possible to dine here as a vegetarian, or even a vegan. Eventually, I do plan to sit down and eat here.

I've always liked this place a tad more than bombay wraps because they allow me to order various combinations of the lamb meat and sauces. Watch out for the sauces labelled hot. They're not kidding around on spicy levels. The quantity is also good enough for 1 meal and an afternoon snack for me. It's not the BEST Indian food ever, but it's nice to have a choice in all the vegetables you want to put in your bowl.

The food here can be enjoyed by anyone.  I don't eat Indian often, and really am only familiar with a few dishes, but you don't need to be familiar with Indian food here. The chicken Rice bowl with the savory tomato (masala sauce) and most of the add in items was delicious, a good amount of food, it came with a fresh piece of naan, and I also got the masala fries (that got better with every fry.) I will be eating here again for sure. My girlfriend got the lamb and it was really tender and flavorful in the naan tacos with a spicy sauce. Enjoy!

Imagine a chipotle... but Indian-inspired rather than Mexican-inspired food. I recommend the bowls-- they come with a protein of your choice, a sauce of your choice (or you can pick multiple sauces, which is fun), whatever veggies you like, and a piece of naan. The naan is not my favorite, because it's not the same quality that you'd get from an actual sit-down Indian restaurant. It tastes more like pita. But it's very reasonably priced and if you have an Indian craving during lunch, hit this place up!
I recommend a rice bowl with chicken and tikka masala sauce. I also ordered the samosas as a side and they hit the spot (for those who don't know, a samosa is like a potato and pea and spice filled fried pastry).

For an Indian, u found their sauces spicy. I did a mix of the tikka sauce and red chili sauce and it was overpowering. I also had the combo on salad so probably there wasn't enough rice or bread to balance it. I had it with chickpeas and paneer which was average. The potato samosas were great. Perfect crispy and balanced flavor of potatoes inside, so I might visit next time for that.

This place is far from nonsense! Get it?! Well the name brought is in the door, but the smell and line kept us there. My fianc and I are in Chicago for the weekend and obviously rely on Yelp for our food needs... And we stumbled upon NaanSense. 

First, think Indian qdoba. You can choose a Naanwhich, a rice bowl or a salad. One protein (chicken, lamb, farmers cheese, chickpeas, or roasted veggies) and a sauce (savory tomato/tikka/mild, cashew ginger/korma/mild, spiced coconut/madras/medium or red chili/vindaloo/hot)  topped with fresh veggies (picketed onions, cabbage slaw, cucumbers, tomatoes and cilantro).  

All the choices look delicious! I personally went with the salad, roasted veggies, all toppings and a cool garlic dressing on the side. In was fantastic. There was a line the whole time we were there and people just kept coming in.. Although no one was leaving, ha. People were enjoying their meals and chatting and eating. I didn't want to leave either, but I felt bad so we got up to give our table away. 

Needed to say I would go back. The space was quaint, the service was quick, and the food was fantastic. If you like Indian food, but don't want to drop a lot and feel too full to walk the city, go to NaanSense, you'll enjoy it, promise.

Chipotle of indian food! Delicious! I got the chicken tikka naanwhich with masala fries. I added cucumber, onions, and garlic cool sauce on it. Perfectly balanced flavors! And the naan was yum. A little hard to eat, but most good things are! 

Gets SUPER busy right around 12:10 so try to come a little early! Also not a lot of seating inside.

I loved the food. Portions and price good. The reason why I only give 3 stars is the staff. I would say it changed a month or so ago. It is really bad. When I came with my friend, there was a line, like five people. There were around five or six staff people. Only one was helping the customers. One was taking of the garbage. One was sweeping and then started helping the customers without the gloves and NOT WASHING her hands!!!, one was at the back, etc. Then they were simply unpleasant. I remember the people before when the place opened and from before this new staff started working there, pleasant, helpful, and organized. Shame, huge shame because the food is good and I liked it. My friend found a hair in her food today. If I were the manager I would fire those people and make sure that whoever works there is clean, and polite.

One of the best experiences I've had with indian cuisine! We catered food from Naansense for a group of 25, that came with large servings of white/brown rice, salad, slaw, chicken, lamb, chicken/potato somosas, and a variety of different indian sauces that ranged from mild to spicy. The lamb was incredibly tender, just melting in your mouth; and the chicken was well seasoned and moist. Everything complemented each other very well, with all flavors coming together to provide a delicious dining experience! My colleagues were also very enthused once the lids started coming off, as the emerging aromas were enticing! Great place to order to lunch, whether individual orders or catering, will definitely be back soon and would recommend to all!

Best,
Charlie

I must say I was pleasantly surprised by Naansense, or as I like to call it, the Indian Chipotle. It really is amazing! I'm Indian, so I may be biased in my review. But the rice bowl with lamb, all the toppings, savory tomato sauce, and green mint dressing (comes with a mini naan) was one of the most flavorful and memorable meals I've had at any Indian establishment. Since this is a fast food place, it gets bonus points for offering really tasty meals. You can't go wrong with the masala fries and chicken samosas. They ran out of the mango smoothie during peak lunch hours, but I'm sure that would've been a delightful accompaniment to the meal. 

You must try it at least once if you're in the area. Also, the staff is really friendly and that stood out during my visit. You won't be disappointed!

Yessss - So stoked I found a new lunch spot after work!

You know you've found a great place when the line is out the door. Luckily they moved it quickly and served me up a big 'ol bowl of delicious food. The food was hot, fresh, and super flavorful. The coconut sauce was ON POINT! I am a baby about spice, and although it was marked as "Medium" I thought it was the perfect amount. Definitely my go-to pick for sauce.

Lastly, have to give the props for the pita bread. It was soooooooo good! So surprised it came from a fast casual restaurant. It was warm and the perfect texture. I'll be back!

I've been slipping... this location is close to work yet this was my first time stopping in for lunch. It's like the Indian equivalent to Mediterranean Naf Naf. The even better thing about Naansense is that the meal won't leave you feeling soooo overly stuffed that you can't be a productive member of society afterwards! I had the chicken vindaloo rice bowl with everything on it and it came with the perfect sized piece of naan on the side. The flavors were really good and the vindaloo had a nice kick to it (but no way was it spicy as hell Andre!!!).

There isn't a ton of seating in there so you may opt to take it to go like I did. I did watch a few patrons fight (not really) over a table opening up. This one chick was so thirsty that she actually left her cell phone on the table (out of her view) while she was in line so that she could claim her spot. A man finished paying first saw and almost lost it seeing that the last open table at the time was taken... by a cell phone! LOL. Before he lost his cool though, I noticed another table opening up and pointed him in that direction. He was so flustered it was funny and I had to share!

I'm definitely putting Naansense into my lunch rotation... don't we all get tired of salads sometimes??

Well, half my mouth doesn't work very well due to wisdom tooth issues, but this place was great from the side hat still works. I got a bowl with chicken and red chili sauce, nothing too wild and crazy because of my tooth issues but it was excellent! It's very much like chipotle for Indian food. If you're thinking about going here, check t out!

I came here with a friend today to give this place another shot. The first time I came here, they had just opened so I figured it was probably even better now.

We came at 11:45 and were lucky to arrive just before the lunch time rush. I had the salad with chickpeas, quinoa, and I had the korma sauce. I also had all the toppings and chose the mint sauce as well as the tamarind sauce.

When I watched them make my salad, I was kind of wondering how all of this was going to work out. The soupy korma sauce all over a salad? It was kind of off putting. Maybe a salad isn't the way to go here, but that is what I ordered. My friend had the lamb salad and he chose the vindaloo sauce. The vindaloo sauce is labeled as being very spicy, but my friend said it was not very hot at all. 

The sauces were a little bland for our liking. I kept wishing that my lunch was more flavorful. Usually Indian food is bursting with flavor but this was kind of meh. The korma sauce should have been more silky/creamy. The tamarind sauce was less tangy than the sauce I usually get at Indian restaurants and was almost watery. Also, the naan that came with it was kind of like a sad little pita/naan hybrid. I was picturing delicious fresh made naan like you'd get from an actual Indian restaurant. The naan wasn't even warm. Sad. 

Unfortunately, my taste buds were left unsatisfied so I do not plan on returning.

Bread, choice of protein, sauce, toppings and more sauce. A big, messy lunch, especially in the loop area, not a bad choice to do a quick and relatively cheap meal. 

I was hoping the naan was going to be a bit thinner and chewier, but it's sort of like a pita bread so the whole thing can't really be eaten like a burrito. I liked the options you can put and the sauces were not bad. If I'm back, I'll try the rice option, much less messier to eat with a side of naan.

The bowls are good and I love their array of vegan options! Almost all the sauces and dressing voices are vegan and nice combination of fusion flavors. Great options for vegan protein :D
Service was wonderful!

Chipotle of indian food! Delicious! I got the chicken tikka naanwhich with masala fries. I added cucumber, onions, and garlic cool sauce on it. Perfectly balanced flavors! And the naan was yum. A little hard to eat, but most good things are! 

Gets SUPER busy right around 12:10 so try to come a little early! Also not a lot of seating inside.

I loved the food. Portions and price good. The reason why I only give 3 stars is the staff. I would say it changed a month or so ago. It is really bad. When I came with my friend, there was a line, like five people. There were around five or six staff people. Only one was helping the customers. One was taking of the garbage. One was sweeping and then started helping the customers without the gloves and NOT WASHING her hands!!!, one was at the back, etc. Then they were simply unpleasant. I remember the people before when the place opened and from before this new staff started working there, pleasant, helpful, and organized. Shame, huge shame because the food is good and I liked it. My friend found a hair in her food today. If I were the manager I would fire those people and make sure that whoever works there is clean, and polite.

One of the best experiences I've had with indian cuisine! We catered food from Naansense for a group of 25, that came with large servings of white/brown rice, salad, slaw, chicken, lamb, chicken/potato somosas, and a variety of different indian sauces that ranged from mild to spicy. The lamb was incredibly tender, just melting in your mouth; and the chicken was well seasoned and moist. Everything complemented each other very well, with all flavors coming together to provide a delicious dining experience! My colleagues were also very enthused once the lids started coming off, as the emerging aromas were enticing! Great place to order to lunch, whether individual orders or catering, will definitely be back soon and would recommend to all!

Best,
Charlie

I must say I was pleasantly surprised by Naansense, or as I like to call it, the Indian Chipotle. It really is amazing! I'm Indian, so I may be biased in my review. But the rice bowl with lamb, all the toppings, savory tomato sauce, and green mint dressing (comes with a mini naan) was one of the most flavorful and memorable meals I've had at any Indian establishment. Since this is a fast food place, it gets bonus points for offering really tasty meals. You can't go wrong with the masala fries and chicken samosas. They ran out of the mango smoothie during peak lunch hours, but I'm sure that would've been a delightful accompaniment to the meal. 

You must try it at least once if you're in the area. Also, the staff is really friendly and that stood out during my visit. You won't be disappointed!

Yessss - So stoked I found a new lunch spot after work!

You know you've found a great place when the line is out the door. Luckily they moved it quickly and served me up a big 'ol bowl of delicious food. The food was hot, fresh, and super flavorful. The coconut sauce was ON POINT! I am a baby about spice, and although it was marked as "Medium" I thought it was the perfect amount. Definitely my go-to pick for sauce.

Lastly, have to give the props for the pita bread. It was soooooooo good! So surprised it came from a fast casual restaurant. It was warm and the perfect texture. I'll be back!

I've been slipping... this location is close to work yet this was my first time stopping in for lunch. It's like the Indian equivalent to Mediterranean Naf Naf. The even better thing about Naansense is that the meal won't leave you feeling soooo overly stuffed that you can't be a productive member of society afterwards! I had the chicken vindaloo rice bowl with everything on it and it came with the perfect sized piece of naan on the side. The flavors were really good and the vindaloo had a nice kick to it (but no way was it spicy as hell Andre!!!).

There isn't a ton of seating in there so you may opt to take it to go like I did. I did watch a few patrons fight (not really) over a table opening up. This one chick was so thirsty that she actually left her cell phone on the table (out of her view) while she was in line so that she could claim her spot. A man finished paying first saw and almost lost it seeing that the last open table at the time was taken... by a cell phone! LOL. Before he lost his cool though, I noticed another table opening up and pointed him in that direction. He was so flustered it was funny and I had to share!

I'm definitely putting Naansense into my lunch rotation... don't we all get tired of salads sometimes??

Well, half my mouth doesn't work very well due to wisdom tooth issues, but this place was great from the side hat still works. I got a bowl with chicken and red chili sauce, nothing too wild and crazy because of my tooth issues but it was excellent! It's very much like chipotle for Indian food. If you're thinking about going here, check t out!

I came here with a friend today to give this place another shot. The first time I came here, they had just opened so I figured it was probably even better now.

We came at 11:45 and were lucky to arrive just before the lunch time rush. I had the salad with chickpeas, quinoa, and I had the korma sauce. I also had all the toppings and chose the mint sauce as well as the tamarind sauce.

When I watched them make my salad, I was kind of wondering how all of this was going to work out. The soupy korma sauce all over a salad? It was kind of off putting. Maybe a salad isn't the way to go here, but that is what I ordered. My friend had the lamb salad and he chose the vindaloo sauce. The vindaloo sauce is labeled as being very spicy, but my friend said it was not very hot at all. 

The sauces were a little bland for our liking. I kept wishing that my lunch was more flavorful. Usually Indian food is bursting with flavor but this was kind of meh. The korma sauce should have been more silky/creamy. The tamarind sauce was less tangy than the sauce I usually get at Indian restaurants and was almost watery. Also, the naan that came with it was kind of like a sad little pita/naan hybrid. I was picturing delicious fresh made naan like you'd get from an actual Indian restaurant. The naan wasn't even warm.

They tried to reinvent chipotle, but failed. 

I had been to naan-sense to meet a friend who works in the loop on a recent trip to Chicago. Another friend accompanying us said it wasn't that great, and we should have listened to him. It isn't really bad, but I could figure out that their flavor palette did not work well, specially if you're used to eating indian food regularly.

Location and Service: 4* -
It is a regular lunch place like thousands others in the loop. It mostly caters to the to-go crowd. The place is a long room, with the counter on the left, and about 8 two top tables lined on the right. There isn't much room around. However, it's pretty clean and tidy.
The employees are very friendly. Since it was my first time, I asked some questions and they patiently explained how it worked, even though there was a short line behind me, and also gave me some samples to try.

Food: 2* -
This is where they go wrong. While trying to create indian bowls, they don't realize not everything that can be mixed will taste good. The mash of rice, curry, protein and salad makes it extremely soggy and unappetizing.
I got a paneer bowl, and my friends got a checkpea and chicken bowls, and all of us weren't very happy with the result. They give you a small naan with the bowl, which was warm and tasty though.
The ingredients are fresh no doubt, but the flavors just don't go well, and in indian cuisine, only certain protein go well with curries. 
We also tried the samosas, which were reasonably good, but they were out of the fries, so couldn't get that.

Value: 3* -
The food has a pretty good value, costing about $8-10. The quantity is large, and I couldn't finish my food. The appetizers are on the more expensive side about $4-5, but they're decent.

It is a decent lunch place, but not great. If you've had good indian food regularly, you will not be very happy with this. But if you're just out to get some flavorful to-go food from work, it's a good option to try out.

Always my go to place for a quick bite and this place gets packed at noon so avoid the lunch hour surge. Their food and spices go well together. My favorite, the chicken bowl with madras curry and cool garlic yogurt as my 2nd sauce to balance out the heat. The paneer and lamb are also good but you can never go wrong with the rice bowl. They give you a slice of naan of course, thus the brand name. Will always be my favorite spot if I'm craving for Indian food and just out of convenience since it's only a block away from the office.

LOVE THIS PLACE. I would describe it as an "Indian Chipotle." Quick, delicious, and inexpensive. 

Indian food can be very expensive, much to the dismay of well, everyone. Naansense combats that issue by offering an Americanized model: single-serving meals with plenty of options.

You start with a base (naanwich, salad, rice bowl, or quinoa for an extra $2)

You then add a protein (chicken, farmer's cheese (paneer) for an extra $1, lamb for an extra $2, or roasted veggies) 

You then choose a sauce (tikka, madras, korma, vindaloo)

Last but not least, you add toppings (pickled onions, cabbage slaw, tomatoes, cucumbers, cilantro) and dressings (cool garlic, sweet-n-tart (pretty sure this is tamarind), green mint, and fire red.

I like that Naansense has easily accessible markers for vegan and gluten-free options. One thing I do wish, however, is that the desserts were actually Indian - it would feel more authentic. The addition of seasonal specials, or rotating specials from different regions of India would also be a great addition to add variety! 

The location, itself, is not somewhere I would choose to sit and eat, but it's definitely an option for those who might want to do so. This is more of a spot for working people in the area, as is reflected by the hours. It's super quick, which makes this a GREAT lunch option - especially when places around the area often have lines out the door and down the street because they aren't as quick.

This place is amazing. I had eaten at the food truck once before, but today I decided to cater in lunch for my team members. The catering was over the top impressive. The delivery guy was SO nice and set everything up for me - including little signs that had the name of all the sauces and how mild, medium, or hot they were. I've catered in a lot of meals from a lot of different places, but this was by far the best experience I had. Did I mention he arrived early? That never happens! 10/10; will definitely cater from them again. 

For those wondering, I did the 3 protein spread with chickpeas, veggies, and chicken. We ate those 2 of the 3. I also ordered 10 of each samosas. Everyone was raving about it.

I brought some co-workers, who were visiting the United States from India, to Naansense for lunch b/c they were "craving Indian food, please!" We had an enjoyable lunch.

Dcor: This is not a big place but it is nicely lit, very clean, and has a very inviting atmosphere. There are just a few tables (I assume most grab and go) but also no line, which was nice. As you order you can see everything that they are preparing and the drink machine and free water are right behind you as you pay. It's a nice setup, a great little spot for lunch.
Bathroom: unknown

Staff: Everyone was very nice and friendly.

Food: I had a chicken rice bowl with cashew ginger sauce and all the toppings. It was good, enjoyable, and everything tasted fresh and was served hot. In addition they gave me a small, warm pita which was very tasty. To drink I had the free water.

Value: The price was spot-on for lunch, right where I expected it to be.

It's a good place for lunch, for Indian food, and I think I'll return again in the future for another meal.

I like Naansense. The restaurant is set up like a Chipotle assembly line with Indian food. The concept is something that I love.

I've been here twice, once right before closing and once around 6pm on a Friday. On the first visit, they had run out of pretty much everything, but the nice dude I ordered some of the Tikka fries and the nice dude gave me a double order. The stuff was pretty tasty.

On my second visit, I got a bowl with chicken and tikka sauce. The toppings are decent and the option of brown rice is nice, but the sauce wasn't as flavorful or yogurty as most restaurant offerings. the chicken was also a little dry.

However, because I love Indian food, I'm happy to give this place another try. They have a bunch of sauces and encourage tasting, so there's a lot more of the restaurant that I want to explore.

Very nice people working there....they even came up to our table and brought us over a sample of their mango smoothie to try and that was yummy (and I'm not even a smoothie person)

There's an array of sauces and the menu is very basic! Excellent for the people who are on their lunch break or anyone rushed for that matter that is craving Indian food!

Fairly disappointing fast casual restaurant that is trying to be the Chipotle of Indian food. Prices were ok but the food was disappointing. The tikka sauce lacked any substantial flavor and the slaw tended to dominate the bowl. Not enough food to fill up someone who is very hungry, which is one of the reasons Chipotle is so popular.

Indian - Pakistani style fare served up sandwich style in wraps with traditional breads.  Something different from typical rice and curry dishes and pretty good the first time around.  I've been to the always good Bombay Wraps nearby and looking for something new I remembered my cousins' suggestion of this place and I finally got a chance recently.  

The only unfortunate circumstance was that I could not eat my wrap fresh.  Had a ways to travel and it sat in it's brown bag till I reached my destination.  Still, however, the wrap was "nice" in taste.  The portion wasn't big enough but the flavors were all there.  I'd grab it again when in the locale.

This is basically an Indian food version of Chipotle but way more flavorful. I walked in at 3:54 on a Friday afternoon. No line. Ordered a chicken bowl with half roasted veggies and was VERY impressed. I got the spiced coconut sauce (madras) which was excellent. The fire red sauce is not super spicy but it adds a nice kick. It's BYOB and there were two tables enjoying alcohol with their meal. Overall, I'm a fan!

I have worked in the Loop for 2.5 years and generally stick to Chipotle, Potbelly's, etc. for lunch or Haute Sausage when I want to really indulge over the lunch hour. Recently I stumbled across Naansense and decided to give it a try. My sense of adventure when it comes to Indian food is almost nonexistent as I can't handle any spice so I opted for a rice bowl with lamb, tomatoes, with the tikka sauce. Unfortunately when I paid for my food I wasn't able to eat it there because there is pretty much no seating available over the lunch hour. I didn't count the number of tables but I swear this place can't seat more than 15 people without the fire department shutting them down for overcrowding.

Anyway, after a cold walk back to my office I was floored at how delicious my lunch was. The lamb was cooked well and the tikka sauce was flavorful and generally not very spicy. I was disappointed with the tiny piece of naan you get with your meal there too and would have liked a little more given the size of the bowl you receive for the rice. For a place called "Naansense" you'd expect naan to be a big focus of each meal but apparently not.

The food at Naansense is great but due to the lack of seating and the small amount of naan you're given I can't give 5 stars. I guess 4 stars it is! Yum.

Very convenient if you take Blue line. Get off at lake and go up the stairs that take you to "Wells and Lake". It will take you right to Naansense. So you don't have to worry about walking far in the cold. 

I went in with a group of 12, we were able to sit together by combining all the tables together. Thankfully, most of the tables were empty because everyone who came in took it to go besides us (this is more of a carry out place then dine in, but dine in possible). Anyways, I went in on a Tuesday night. They only had 2 workers so if it gets busy, you'll have to wait (a while). This place is very similar to chipotle, but it's wrapped with a Naan and they have some indian sauces. Besides that, it's like chipotle. 

They do have samosas, but they are average. My friend said the mango lassi is good, Indians love that! They have options for vegetarians and meat eaters. If you want it to be extra spicy, let them know, they'll do a good job of it! If it came down between Chipotle and here, I would go with chipotle. But this place isn't bad!

However, because I love Indian food, I'm happy to give this place another try. They have a bunch of sauces and encourage tasting, so there's a lot more of the restaurant that I want to explore.

If you want Indian food the fast version (like a fast food style) then this is your place. The food was great and the service was excellent! 

Very nice people working there....they even came up to our table and brought us over a sample of their mango smoothie to try and that was yummy (and I'm not even a smoothie person)

There's an array of sauces and the menu is very basic! Excellent for the people who are on their lunch break or anyone rushed for that matter that is craving Indian food!

Fairly disappointing fast casual restaurant that is trying to be the Chipotle of Indian food. Prices were ok but the food was disappointing. The tikka sauce lacked any substantial flavor and the slaw tended to dominate the bowl. Not enough food to fill up someone who is very hungry, which is one of the reasons Chipotle is so popular.

This place used to be nice, but their service went really down. The server was so rude, this is going to be my last time here. And so will be my recommendation to all my colleagues.

Indian - Pakistani style fare served up sandwich style in wraps with traditional breads.  Something different from typical rice and curry dishes and pretty good the first time around.  I've been to the always good Bombay Wraps nearby and looking for something new I remembered my cousins' suggestion of this place and I finally got a chance recently.  

The only unfortunate circumstance was that I could not eat my wrap fresh.  Had a ways to travel and it sat in it's brown bag till I reached my destination.  Still, however, the wrap was "nice" in taste.  The portion wasn't big enough but the flavors were all there.  I'd grab it again when in the locale.

This is basically an Indian food version of Chipotle but way more flavorful. I walked in at 3:54 on a Friday afternoon. No line. Ordered a chicken bowl with half roasted veggies and was VERY impressed. I got the spiced coconut sauce (madras) which was excellent. The fire red sauce is not super spicy but it adds a nice kick. It's BYOB and there were two tables enjoying alcohol with their meal. Overall, I'm a fan!

Surprised, I must say. Place has shortage of place to sit, it's crowded but man people still keep coming in .....That shows they do serve good innovative food "inspired" by indian cuisine. Energetic team ready to go above and beyond to make sure customer understands what he/she is going to have. Masala fries is must as side order.

I have worked in the Loop for 2.5 years and generally stick to Chipotle, Potbelly's, etc. for lunch or Haute Sausage when I want to really indulge over the lunch hour. Recently I stumbled across Naansense and decided to give it a try. My sense of adventure when it comes to Indian food is almost nonexistent as I can't handle any spice so I opted for a rice bowl with lamb, tomatoes, with the tikka sauce. Unfortunately when I paid for my food I wasn't able to eat it there because there is pretty much no seating available over the lunch hour. I didn't count the number of tables but I swear this place can't seat more than 15 people without the fire department shutting them down for overcrowding.

Anyway, after a cold walk back to my office I was floored at how delicious my lunch was. The lamb was cooked well and the tikka sauce was flavorful and generally not very spicy. I was disappointed with the tiny piece of naan you get with your meal there too and would have liked a little more given the size of the bowl you receive for the rice. For a place called "Naansense" you'd expect naan to be a big focus of each meal but apparently not.

The food at Naansense is great but due to the lack of seating and the small amount of naan you're given I can't give 5 stars. I guess 4 stars it is! Yum.

No flavor. If you like your Indian food authentic, don't eat here. I had ordered a paneer tikka bowl and all I tasted was tomato and uncooked paneer.

Very convenient if you take Blue line. Get off at lake and go up the stairs that take you to "Wells and Lake". It will take you right to Naansense. So you don't have to worry about walking far in the cold. 

I went in with a group of 12, we were able to sit together by combining all the tables together. Thankfully, most of the tables were empty because everyone who came in took it to go besides us (this is more of a carry out place then dine in, but dine in possible). Anyways, I went in on a Tuesday night. They only had 2 workers so if it gets busy, you'll have to wait (a while). This place is very similar to chipotle, but it's wrapped with a Naan and they have some indian sauces. Besides that, it's like chipotle. 

They do have samosas, but they are average. My friend said the mango lassi is good, Indians love that! They have options for vegetarians and meat eaters. If you want it to be extra spicy, let them know, they'll do a good job of it! If it came down between Chipotle and here, I would go with chipotle. But this place isn't bad!

On my way to a concert Tuesday night and I needed to grab a quick bite to eat. Indian food sounded good but it's usually a sit-down commitment and very filling, so when I saw naansense it was the perfect solution! How come I've never seen this indian style fast food concept anywhere other than Chicago before?? It's genius!

There was no line so I ordered the chicken naanwich and it was ready in a snap. The taste was good but not great - which I attribute to the naan bread. It was evening, and probably had been out all day (texture was kinda tough). But I'd like to go back during the day to try it again, maybe with some sides and the mango lassi :)

Finally was able to try this place!!!

I found this concept similar to Subway with an Indian twist. Got myself a veggie stir fry naanwich (the base is a naan) with a lil white rice, pickled onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, mint dressing and a chilli gravy to dip the naanwich in. Also ordered a side of aloo samosas. I found it delicious and aptly priced. Would highly recommend for all those missing Indian food after a busy day

Love the name of this place and decided to try it out for lunch. It seems to be more of a takeout spot, but they do have a few tables along the wall. Tried the bowl with the vindaloo sauce and it was interesting. The vindaloo sauce wasn't too spicy for me, but I also tried the masala fries and that kinda upped the overall spice factor. The masala fries were actually not my favorite, however, the sauce that comes with them is super yummy!! Service is quick.

The Vindaloo is spicy as hell!!!!
I agree with Stefanie A when she says this is the Indian version of Chipotle as it has the behind the counter assembly line setup going and you can pick what kind of goodies to top off your meal. You can get your meal on pita or in a bowl...I chose the lamb vindaloo bowl and I was warned about the spiciness of it. I got tomatoes, couscous and onions on top of it. Was really good and as I mentioned spicy as hell!!!! I will try the chicken tikka bowl next time around for sure. The marsala fries were very good with the yellow honey mustard-esque sauce

I like the look of the place and its a funky (in a good way) setup with paintings no the wall (for sale) and hip hop music coming out of the speakers...they were playing some good joints by Mos Def and Erykah Badu by the way. The staff is very upbeat and makes your ordering experience pretty cool. A few tables across the wall if you want to dine in, but of course you can have your order to go. There is a water dispenser in the back to wash down the spice!

Pros:

Sauce served on the side

What a great concept for a restaurant - very original, and incorporates a food category (Indian) that I like already.  

Naansense has fresh food in a naan wrap, and prices are comparable to what you'd pay at Chipotle (comparable because it also sells fresh food in a wrap, but a tortilla one).  I tried the tikka chicken on rice, the korma chicken on salad, and the lamb naanwich on Korma.  

I would have guessed the naanwich would be the signature item, but it can be a bit of a sloppy mess, and I ended up eating it with a plastic knife and fork instead of like a burrito.  So if I ate here regularly, I'd probably be eating more of the salad or rice options. 

I was glad to get there at 12:05 and just beat the rush - this place gets busy!  I liked also that they had infused water and self-serve cups while you wait in that line.

Because it is the only place of it's kind that I know of ("fast Indian"), I have to give it the 5 stars, and look forward to it's inevitable expansion.

The food is really good. I usually get a paneer and chickpea bowl and have not been disappointed. I give the food a 4.5. 

Here is the reason for the 3 stars: This location, however, is severely lacking. The service level is so much poorer than the Clinton location. A lunch line extends out on to the street, not due to popularity, but slow service. Additionally, there is no fountain machine at this location.

I absolutely love this place more than the place they replaced! What was the name of that place???? I don't remember and I don't care. The food was similar, but Nannsense wins by far.

I wanted to be healthy and grab a salad, but since I know their known for the chicken naanwich I had to go with that. So glad I did! The chicken is season well and tender, ingredients are fresh, and the makhani sauce ties everything together.

Since I'm on a healthy streak I figured why not try the spiced fries. Ummmmm.....DELICIOUS! Definitely not spicy, but the flavor is far from the norm and I like the soft texture (not a fan of crunchy fries). The weird yellow dipping sauce for the fries wasn't that good, but to me anything beats ketchup so there still winning! Meal came to around $10 but the quality and portion size of the food made it worthwhile. I can't wait to try more of the menu.

More of a takeout spot. Table seating is limited. If you go during off peak hours you can possibly snag a table, but prime time one is hard to come by.

I ordered a roasted veggie bowl last night with the spicy sauce- they delivered a paneer bowl, no veggies, with mild sauce. The paneer portion size was generous, but I wasn't crazy about the taste- lacked spice and flavor- but of course my experience would probably be different if I got what I actually ordered. Also got the potato samosas- pretty standard.

Sadly I wasn't a fan and I really wanted to be cos it's close to my office. I didn't like the taste of the food much.

My wife and I tried this place in the advice of yelp reviewers, however we did not enjoy the food at all. The oil used in deep frying tasted old, or at least had  a strange taste.

Their name might as well be "F*** You Bombay Wraps." 

They completely copied the idea of the place about a block away only their food is better and the name is waaaay catchier. Sure...there is enough lunch business in this area for them to coexist, but I can't imagine their neighbor is going to be inviting them to any summer barbecues. 

The fast casual concept is pretty formulaic only with an Indian flare. Fresh, somewhat healthy food quickly, and for a very reasonable price. They do wraps, bowls, and salads, with chicken, lamb and veggie variations. Yeah there's a couple other things on the menu, but that's the nuts and bolts of the business. 

The food is great, the service efficient, and the price is competitive with other lunch options in the area. Just a matter of preference, but I think they beat Bombay down the street in the Pepsi challenge.

This place is alright.

The sheer variety of options and fresh ingredients and sauces make this place a solid place to grab a filling meal, whether it's a wrap, rice bowl, or salad.

Yeah, it's true that not having the chicken or lamb stewing in the curries doesn't make it taste as good as it could. No argument there. But considering the speed with which you can grab your food and get down to eating, it's a trade-off that some will be willing to accept.

Excellent indian fast food.
Many call it the Chipotle of Indian food and rightly so. You can get a roll or salad or sandwich and add in met/veggies along with Indian chutneys based on your spice preference. The taste is fusion and delicious. They could have more choice in chutneys/sauces though. Currently there is only 1 associated with each of the 3 spice levels. 
Average cost comes upto 9$ including taxes. If you are craving indian but are in a hurry and want something neatly packed, this is the place to go.

Naansense is absolutely amazing. I am extremely grateful to have been introduced to a place that does not mess around when it comes to delicious indian-style fast food. 

Not only is it extremely vegetarian friendly, but the vindaloo is nice and spicy with a good kick. this place may be busy beyond measure, but that's simply a strong acknowledgement of their well-earned success.

My impression of this place is an Indian chipotle. The first time I came here, I got a bowl with madras sauce and hated my meal. However, the next couple times I came, I got a bowl with the vindaloo and tikka sauces and loved it! I think the mango lassi is pretty good, and I really liked the ginger soda! The masala fries were nice with a kick to it with the seasoning and sauce.  Will be coming back when I'm in the city

Tried it twice in last couple weeks. Didn't let me down. And I'm one who likes his food spicy. And, Indian spice is hard to come by in Chicago. Even though this is kind of like Indo-Mexican fusion, I just love their flavors.

Not authentic Indian though, but close enough. Go ahead and try you won't be disappointed.

This Chipotle style Indian place is delightful! Honestly, I was captivated by its witty name and that's why I chose to eat here. When I first got here I realized its not a typical sit-down dinner kind of a place. I was a bit disappointed. Soon enough, I went ahead and tried the veggie rice bowl and it did not let me down. It is a healthy single-serving, fast food option. For people who are intimidated by the array of food items served during an Indian meal, this is a perfect start. I would suggest this place to somebody new to Indian food, or even who would like to grab a quick bite. The staff was really friendly too.

Delicious chipotle style Indian food. Flavorful, quick, and very fresh tasting. Be warned, if you ask for spicy sauce, you shall receive! Also, the masala fries are great!

I was lucky enough to catch the last day of the $5 deal (entre, side, and drink)! The line was insane because of this but worth it.

I got the brown rice bowl (comes with naan) with chicken in vindaloo sauce and red pepper chutney with all of the toppings: pickled onions, cabbage slaw, farmer's cheese, chickpea noodles, mixed greens, quinoa salad, tomato and cucumber, and roasted vegetable. It was delicious. If you like spicy like I do, then the vindaloo and red pepper chutney is for you. Honestly, I should have gotten a 'cooler' chutney (garlic yogurt) because my mouth was on fire, although I enjoyed it...but hot on hot is def a dangerous combo. The chicken itself was moist and juicy and the toppings were quite fresh. However, the veggie samosa was just okay and find Bombay Wrap's samosas to be much better.

Their service was splendid. Even though the wait in line was around a half hour that afternoon, the staff was very friendly and did the best they could, as the line did move along. They ran out of naan for a quick second and reassured us that fresh ones will be out in a minute, in which it did. They ran out of cups, so we got to choose whatever was in the fridge (I got Vitamin Water). Forks ran out but was replenished quickly. Again, great service. I could tell they were a little overwhelmed by the increasing number of customers but that didn't stop their friendly demeanor and smiles and hustle & bustle.

The atmosphere was not the most comfortable because it was so busy, as the line of people draped along my table, and pretty much all the tables, as the place is somewhat small.

Nonetheless, delicious Indian food with American styled options, affordable prices, and great service. Also, dietary restriction friendly place!

I tried this place for the second time. I ordered online. My food was ready when I arrived. The chicken was tender, but reminded me of chicken thighs, which I am not fond of. It had good spice and flavor, but my stomach was killing me the next day. Sadly, because I prefer spicy food, but can't handle it as much anymore, I don't think I will be back here.

This place is alright.

The sheer variety of options and fresh ingredients and sauces make this place a solid place to grab a filling meal, whether it's a wrap, rice bowl, or salad.

Yeah, it's true that not having the chicken or lamb stewing in the curries doesn't make it taste as good as it could. No argument there. But considering the speed with which you can grab your food and get down to eating, it's a trade-off that some will be willing to accept. And the sheer variety of options and fresh ingredients and sauces make this place a solid place to grab a filling meal, whether it's a wrap, rice bowl, or salad.

The masala fries are really tasty as are the samosas. Probably the best thing on the menu.

Excellent indian fast food.
Many call it the Chipotle of Indian food and rightly so. You can get a roll or salad or sandwich and add in met/veggies along with Indian chutneys based on your spice preference. The taste is fusion and delicious. They could have more choice in chutneys/sauces though. Currently there is only 1 associated with each of the 3 spice levels. 
Average cost comes upto 9$ including taxes. If you are craving indian but are in a hurry and want something neatly packed, this is the place to go.

Naansense is absolutely amazing. I am extremely grateful to have been introduced to a place that does not mess around when it comes to delicious indian-style fast food. 

Not only is it extremely vegetarian friendly, but the vindaloo is nice and spicy with a good kick. this place may be busy beyond measure, but that's simply a strong acknowledgement of their well-earned success.

Do eat here. Seriously, do not skip this place if you are downtown.

My impression of this place is an Indian chipotle. The first time I came here, I got a bowl with madras sauce and hated my meal. However, the next couple times I came, I got a bowl with the vindaloo and tikka sauces and loved it! I think the mango lassi is pretty good, and I really liked the ginger soda! The masala fries were nice with a kick to it with the seasoning and sauce.  Will be coming back when I'm in the city

We ordered delivery from here to our hotel. Delivery was fast but they forgot our mango lassi. Sauces were a little hastily thrown in and one was leaking. Food was good for the most part.

I had heard about Naansense and wanted to see how they fared with their menu. Since they're open during lunch only and I never make it to the North Loop section of The Loop, I was fortunate enough to have a day off and could sample something.

Chicken plate. Mango lassi.

Let me get the fact that the service is top out of the way now. It's nice going into a dining establishment where the staff is either knowledgeable about the offerings they have or they're at least conversational. Naansense gets an uptick for their quality of hospitality.

The Chipotle style concept to ordering food has run its course and Indian food simply cannot abide by that rule of thumb. There is an Indian influence, but with Indian food being my favourite cuisine hands-down, I am aware of when influence overshadows authenticity. The food is great, but my palate has been exposed to Indian food in India, London, Toronto, and along Chicago's Devon Street such that my take on fast food Indian is unfair.

There are some wraps, salad bowls, and wraps that I will try in the future. For those of you who are interested in trying out Naansense, I think you may find it to be a slightly unique and enjoyable experience. Go! Go! Go!

Yes! A new Indian lunch option has been added to the Loop! 

Naansense is currently offering a grand opening special at $5 including an entree, side, and drink. Such offer is irresistible and with successful marketing tactics, the Loopsters have eagerly mobbed this place. I arrived at 1:20pm on Friday to find a snake line extending from the door to the counter. Wait time was 25 minutes. 

When it was finally my turn to order, the lamb was sold out. *cue the huge sad puppy face* I had to opt for the chicken naanwich instead which did not disappoint. Chunks of dark chicken meat was placed atop the lukewarm naan and paired with mixed greens, pickled onions, tomatoes, cucumber, makhani sauce, and garlic yogurt chutney. The meat was tender and juicy. Flavors are mild and aroma was nonexplosive. You do not have to worry about returning to work smelling of spices and chutney or causing a disturbance in your cubicle as you munch away. 

For my side, I had the veggie samosa which did not come with any accompaniments. The coating was thick but well fried. The interior was filled with mashed boiled potato. It was subtly spiced and chutney'ed but the potatoes were slightly raw even though the coating was well fried. I assume they were in a hurry to make a fresh batch and left the fryer on high instead of slowly frying and turning it for a more well-rounded completion. 

(I also assume most of the edges will be smoothed out after their opening week and with the $5 deal gone. By then, quality should pick up as they adjust to the lunch rush. )

Note to self: The rice bowls are very tempting and most likely less of a mess. The naanwich was difficult to manage without having sauce drip down my fingers or the meat and sauce breaking through the naan.

Seriously, I love good food and this place is unique and hits the spot , so it was a no-brainer to bring the Naansense guys over to cater for my grad party. 

Most of my friends were surprised that I got Indian food catered because a lot of people are afraid of Indian food or never had it before. But it was a good thing I did because it was a hit. Even the indian people loved it.

The gentlemen set up everything for me and made it look damn good with the sauces and curries, oh my.The three meat spread was perfect, everyone was satisfied . People kept asking where the restaurant was and suggested that they should open up another location in the suburbs.

All in all, writing this review makes me hungry

The staff is nice and knowledgeable.  Were able to sample the korma and tikka masala sauces before we ordered. My boyfriend preferred the lamb with tikka masala and I preferred chicken.

Overall, I was really disappointed BECAUSE I had high expectations of the place. I am a huge fan of Indian food- it's my favorite type of cuisine.

I expected an Indian version of Chipotle, but the thing about Chipotle is that it is very flavorful... Naansense was kind of lackluster in this department, especially for the price range.  The food was super Americanized, which isn't normally a problem for me, but there's the good kind and the bad kind. If the price was $5-6 it would be reasonable, but in reality it's closer to $8-9.

I did like the sauce that came with the seasoned fries, but the fries themselves were not a big deal even though they cost almost $4.  The sauce tasted like mayo, mustard, and a pinch of garam masala.

Lastly, they had orange infused water in the back, which seems like a good idea, but that day it tasted like feet.

I understand that this place must be good for people who don't want Subway or a generic lunch who work nearby, but I won't be coming back.

PSA: lentil croquettes are back!

This is one of the better food options in the Loop after 5pm (though I may be biased because I live around the corner). The employees are always friendly and I appreciate the breadth of vegetarian options (fresh veggies, paneer, etc.). The fries are also unexpectedly delicious. I don't know what spices they use on them or the dip, but it's so worth a try. 

Lately, they've been changing up the menu a bit. PLEASE BRING BACK LENTIL CROQUETTES! Those were the best and were the reason why I get dinner here at least once a week. I don't type in caps lock very often, so you know they're good.

Oh I love this place!!! I usually frequent this place during lunch time since it's so close to my work place and it is always packed during those hours! 
However, the service is quick and even with long lines, you're usually out of there with your food in 10 minutes.
The people are friendly and efficient and I love their selection of sauces and proteins. The quality of food is good and I've had both - the rice bowls as well as the naanwich. Their sauces are good and flavorful and you pretty much can't go wrong with ordering anything here. They could definitely improve on their mango lassi though - I've had better. 
But overall - I think it's a great place to eat and I would go here again.

The food here is great. I have come during both lunch rush and early evening, and I never had a bad eating experience. The masala fries are to die for! They are seasoned so deliciously that my friend and I always split an order. The paneer is my favorite choice of protein. It tastes wonderful and is very filling. I usually get a bowl because the naanwich can get messy lol the bowl makes it easier to eat and you can even get a little naan on the side.

I've read some negative reviews of the mango lassi but I love it. It is nicely flavored and it has a thick texture that I can't find at other Indian restaurants.

I am always referring my friends here and meeting people for lunch here because it's that good! If you are new to Indian food or looking for a different place to eat, I suggest you try this place out. 

BTW, the nickname for this place is Indian Chipotle because of how you order. In my opinion, the lively atmosphere and the greater possibilities of yummy food combinations makes this place way better than Chipotle.

After I wrote the review, the owner reached out to me, which I really appreciated. The extra bit of attention does go a long way. I appreciate that he cares a lot about the opinions of Yelpers and is willing to go the extra mile to rectify a bad experience.

I went again and tried the lamb brown rice bowl, the lassi, and the spicy fries. There was a line but it moved relatively quickly. I got there right before 1pm. I really enjoyed my brown rice bowl with lamp, and it was very filling. Imagine a Chipotle bowl but with an Indian twist. I liked that you could calibrate the level of spiciness that you wanted and there were an endless variety of sauces you could get. They were also generous with the meat.

I was a little disappointed in the fries because they weren't fresh but they were well-seasoned. Perhaps it'd be better if they weren't pre-packaged.

What I LOVED was the mango lassi!!! I will definitely come back to grab that again. For $3, it was a delectable treat. So creamy but not TOO sweet. Great way to end the meal. Be sure to try that!

Thanks Hiran for reaching out! Your attention did not go unnoticed.

Very cool spot and concept. Picture chipotle or roti but with an Indian inspired menu. I had the chicken with basmati rice and both tasted delicious. I also had the pickled onions and Indian style coleslaw. You also pick a sauce which I didn't bother with but tasted and it was great. I loved the cool mayo drizzled on top of the bowl. They have reduced hours on weekends as its in a business district. The girl working Sam was amazing. So friendly and helpful. I didn't get the name of the guy that was working with her but he was extremely rude he seemed to be her manager. I came around the time of closing and was on foot. It was just me and probably wouldn't have taken more than 5 minutes to eat.  I ordered for here and by the time I was paying he says to Sam "um were closed" he didn't even have the courtesy to say it to me he said it to her right in front of me. She then asked if it was ok if I took it to go.  I said I guess I could stand out front and eat it if they give me a fork. And they seemed to think that was ok.  I really don't understand the problem with letting me eat my food while they put away the food and closed up. Why put someone in that akward position. Note for management.  Don't let someone walk in. Make a "for here" order and then tell them as they are paying that they have to take it to go. I'm sure I'll come back one day as the food was very tasty and I recommend you try it. But that treatment was enough to rub me the wrong way and have me stay away for a while.

The Chipotle of Indian cuisine. They do rice bowls and naan wraps.

Their naan is delicious. Its slightly sweet and buttery.

I got a bowl with lamb and the third sauce on the list. I think it was korma mixed with a little of the spicy sauce.

They have a bunch of side sauces to add at the end. I got a little of the mint chutney and the yogurt to drop in on the side.

I write this review as I finish my meal...

First off, I like the food. It is delicious. BUT the service needs work. It's not like they're rude or stand off ish, but it feels like the entire staff has ADHD. If you eat at Naansense do not bother ordering pickup or delivery....

If you order pickup they will not have your order ready when you get there... it just means you'll be waiting by the cash register while they make your food instead of going through the line. 

If you order delivery, I assume it's the same as pickup only instead the delivery person has to wait for their food, and if they're running late I can only assume you will get your food even later than expected. ( IE, today it took over an hour and a half to get 2 chicken naanwiches... got a call around an hour after the order telling us it was running behind and to apologize, they said they would add some samosas to the order to make up for it.... which they forgot. )

Anyhow, to sum it up. Naansense, you're tasty, but if I need a quick bite I'm probably going to order elsewhere as you need to get your game together.
