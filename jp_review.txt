Shhhhh....Psst!  I have a secret to tell you: This is "Da Bestest Sushi in Chicago!"  Truthfully, I am reluctant to share their GREAT review because it is already so hard to get reservations.    But it's about my peeps! my fans! about YOU!  not me :) .   

So let's be real, there are many good to okay sushi places in Chicago.   
                                                                                                             
    But often they are a forgettable experience.                               
                                                                                                        
PG-13 review warning :    C'mon now, we're talking about raw fish; often not much to the flavor profile to distinguish itself from other places.    So often with sushi places is the D-Test (the question about raw fish), did I get sick afterwards (D test , as in Diarrhea :) or not?!!) .      Obviously the bad places means bad fish ......

Back to Kai Zan:
 The creativity, the rice, the sauces, the taste, the combinations and the service.    Mmm, mmm GREAT.   Had the omakase prix fixed menu @ $65 each.   Reasonable. Yummy. Quickly served.     Tues and Weds they have an early bird special for $35 each.                                        Be sure to note the address because signage is very hard to see.   But like some other top places (Alinea), poor signage doesn't matter because so many people go there already or look for it!                           ................So remember this place is our little secret !

Hands down my favorite Japanese place in town. Having been in Chicago for four years, somehow I have never been to Kai Zan, but this visit completely wowed me. 

We sat at the bar seats and got to see how the chefs prepared for each course. I would highly recommend getting the omakase (or the premium one if you have tried the original omakase but wanted more high end / sophisticated raw materials to start with). Food is served to you in a super organized structure, and you won't experience a long gap or need to wait between two courses for sure. 

My favorite dish would probably be the uni tartare that's off the omakase menu. The uni has a super rich, satisfying texture - wrapping the tartare in the crunchy seaweed adds another layer to it! Within the omakase menu, the first couple of appetizers are simply amazing. The last couple of main dishes could be a bit salty. 

Overall, great experience and I'll be back again! This restaurant is definitely on par with momotaro, if not better. Also, remember to get the lava cake!! I love Japanese desserts and the lava cake here paired with black sesame ice cream will wrap up your dinner pretty well, and send you home with a happy tummy. :)

From quality to presentation, this restaurant was phenomenal. We had the premium omakase and the regular omakase to compare, and the premium one was definitely higher quality. I loved how not only do the dishes taste good, their creativity really shined through as well. Service was great too, our server explained every dish in detail, and even the sushi chef would ask us from time to time how we liked everything. There are 10 dishes to each omakase and I listed the prices below. We would return in the future... 

Price: Premium omakase is $120 
Regular omakase is $65.

As many reviews already stated, "Best sushi ever" given the ingredients that we had it was the best quality ever. We ended up having both the premium and regular omakase. Both were amazing but wouldn't be something to be doing all the time. Both Omakase was a 10 course meal each and both had amazing ingredients. But each shined in its own perspective. Starting with the premium we had to reserve it ahead of time along with put reservation to ensure we get one. The ingredients were high scale and tasted amazing. This contained stuff such as wagyu beef, blue fin tuna, applewood smoked yellowtail, and etc. As for the regular one it was more tasteful since it contained more fish for half the price. Overall worth trying each one first.

Tasty sushi but I feel like it's for more first time sushi eaters. 

I recommend making reservations because this place fills up fast. We decided with the $65 omakase with the $5 uni toppings. 

I thought all the sushi and sashimi were amazing and loved everything from it. The shooters were the best part! The carpaccio was flavorful and bomb. The cooked stuff was just aight and nothing memorable. I also didn't like how fast our food was coming out for an omakase experience! 

The service was excellent and very attentive. 

For my next visit, I'll try the premium omakase!

Splendid experience, 100% recommend! We ordered the Chef's Choice Omakase & it is definitely the way to go!

You will have a perfectly coursed out meal that is truly DELICIOUS, diverse & so, so fresh! The $65 price tag seems fair (and maybe even cheap) considering the quality of food & thought put into the creation of the meal!

After every course, my husband and I had a new favorite dish! It got better and better as it went. While each dish is a smaller-bite sized portion, there are enough dishes & spaced out nicely that you really do leave satisfied. 

Pair your meal with some of the plentiful sake or wine options & you have the recipe for a great night out! I absolutely plan on coming back and trying out the Premium Omakase!

Had an early reservation. Everything was great. Did the omakase as suggested by our server. Added the uni with the $5.00 addition. The meal did not disappoint. We left happy and satisfied. The only thing I can mention is that towards the middle of our meal, we felt they were rushing service as they obviously had a second seating after us. 
We were also seated by the bar which was awesome as we had the culinary view. It would have been nice if we could have lingered but I do understand that they have to flip  tables.

The quality of the ingredients, the spectacular presentation of the dishes, and the relaxing atmosphere makes Kai Zan one of the best restaurants in Chicago. 

I went with a group of four and we were seated in one of their private booths.  Our server was friendly and made some great recommendations.  The 10 course Omakase is around $65 and is well worth it.  I'm personally new to seafood and didn't want to commit to my own Omakase so our server had suggested that I join my husband's for an additional $15.  We shared most of the courses and the courses that were meant to be enjoyed as single bites (ex: angry crab), they brought out an additional "bite" for me.   

In addition to the Omakase we also ordered all three of the daily specials.  If you're there and they have Wagyu, go for it!   It was $10 per piece but it was well worth it.   Their taro chip special was great too, it reminded me of ceviche. 

If you like seafood, I suggest the Omakase.  If you're on the fence like me, skip the Omakase and order  la carte.  Although I enjoyed most of the courses, I couldn't stomach the oyster shooters and didn't enjoy the orange rush (sushi scallops wrapped in salmon).   Again, I didn't enjoy these dishes because I don't love seafood, not because they weren't good.   

If you only get one thing, let it be the Escolar pearls.  It's quite easily one of my favorite dishes of all time! 

Tips: It's BYOB (limit of 2 bottles)
         It's popular (make your reservations in advance)
         Go with a group (So you can be seated in a private booth)

Last week was my 3rd time coming to Kai Zan for their omikase menu and once again, they did not disappoint. This is probably one of the best Japanese cuisines in Chicago. 

First, I cannot stress enough to make reservations. The restaurant is quite small so if you walk in, it may not be possible to get a table. When you do make a reservation, they only allow for your party to sit for 1.5 hours. This allows for them to turn the table over for the next guest. If you make a reservation with a larger party, they will likely take your credit card information.

Now the food. You can order the omikase menu or you could choose to order off the regular menu. I definitely have to come back and order the normal menu. Do not fear the omikase. The chef/staff will work with you if there are certain things you don't like or have allergies. They were able to tailor the menu for me so that I didn't miss out on the goodness. Out of the 10 items, my favorite were the escolar pearls. They will render you speechless. They lightly torch the escolar and give it a smoky flavor. To top it off, the pearls are accompanied with an amazing truffle soy sauce. I could just order a plate of those. The crab wrapped in raw tuna, sushi, sashimi and hot dishes were also amazing. Some of the 10 dishes may be small, but don't let that fool you. I could not even finish my 10rh course!

Needless to say, you don't have to twist my arm to come back here!

This is one of those places I have yearned to try for a few years and I have either had plans canceled or was just plain lazy or could not find a reservation within the time frame I would like to eat. Well that has all come to an end now!!!!

I got the chance to come by this past Tuesday with a 7pm reservation with my very good friend. Not the biggest place but very nice looking and a bit fancier than your normal sushi joint. We were lucky enough to get one of the booths which was awesome. Our server was pretty much on point and basically walked us through the best option which was about 10 courses for $65 each...done!!!! To try so much for $65 at this place is a helluva deal!

Started out with the Madai Carpaccio (Japanese red snapper, basil, olive oil and black tobiko) and it was a nice starter and we both enjoyed.

Next up was the escolar and maguro rolls with truffle oil which were very good..actually we were like wow we should stop here if it gets better than this. 

Angry Crab was next as its basically spicy crab wrapped in tuna  with spicy mayo and tempura...pretty decent.

The Shooters were pretty nice as they came in the form of a shot and they included oysters and scallops, quail egg, black tobiko, ponzu sauce, scallions and tobasco....woooo that was good. Probably the best 4 shots I've ever taken.

Orange Rush was next and it was seared scallops and salmon which was good

Tuna Dashi was amazing and a break in the action. It was a broth with shitake mushrooms, little neck clams and tuna....It was very good and flavorful AF

Main Dish was tako wasabi, shrimp and pork belly on a stick...good...the wasabi was nice!

Fiesta Maki was good and had a bit of a spice to it

Dynamyte Mussels were definitely dynamite as they included scallion mayo, black tobiko and masago...very good flavor...probably the best mussels I've had!

Assorted Sashimi closed out the courses and it was very good.

I washed it all down with a 2016 Summer Water rose'...2 glasses did the trick. My buddy had a blanc and he said it was one of the best he has had. 

This place was well worth my 5 year wait to try it out and is now my favorite sushi place in the city! Multiple visits will probably be made within the next few months!

Great spot for wonderful sashimi with good service... Had the chefs choice omakase which was a really great value considering the quantity and quality of fish.  All the courses were imaginative and /or beautifully presented, but in terms of flavor the first couple courses were definitely my favorites (madai carpaccio & escolar/maduro pearls).  

We also had the full dessert menu (hey it was a group, stop judging- even though the waiter totally did :).  The mochi cake was the only one I didn't care for, the rest ranged from yum (chocolate cake) to interesting (matcha creme brle)

We had one of the private booths that was really roomy for a group of 4 and the service was efficient...  

Overall definitely plan to head back, perhaps try the premium omakase or other items off the menu...

Now I know why people are always raving about this place! We were finally able to snag a table here for my birthday dinner. The area is pretty quiet and from the outside at night it's a bit hard to find. I was told it's small and no joke it is. 
 
Our reservation was on a Saturday night at 8pm. Got there on time and only had to wait 4 minutes four our table. The restaurant gives you an option to either buy drinks from them or bring your own bottle for 12 dollars corkage fee. We opted to drink the wine we brought. The hubs was a bit reluctant to do the omakase thinking it might be too much food. The omakase was 10 dishes so like 2 from each section of the menu. Either way, I was dead set on doing the tasting. Needless to say he realized his wife is right. 

We ordered the regular omakase instead of the premium one. I believe the premium has uni and foie gras. We noticed the omakase was a popular option. It doesn't hurt it only costs 65 bucks. Much cheaper than other places would charge. Each dish was delicious! If you're a slow eater like me beware since the dishes come out fast! We were impressed by their efficiency. I could've done without the Angry Crab. It just didn't stand out. The sashimi was like butter in your mouth. The red snapper carpaccio was a dish I would order 20 times over. We really enjoyed the oyster shooter and how the flavors complimented each other. All of the dishes were great just minus the angry crab. 

The service was wonderful and on point. We were lucky to sit in front of the kitchen allowing us to watch each dish come together. We did order the chocolate lava cake as our dessert. The black sesame ice cream blew us away. The flavor of the ice cream was just a tad sweet but had a great berry flavor as well. Skip the cake and just get the ice cream instead. Overall, my high expectations for Kai Zan was met. We are already planning to come back for the premium omakase.

Considering I love nothing more than raw fish it's a shame it took me so long to get here. Small restaurant + melt-in-your--mouth sushi = difficult to get a reservation. However, my friend put our names on a waitlist awhile ago and got a call the day before they had a table free up. And so we traded in our original Italian plans for for sushi. 

They had a perfect table waiting for us- our own little secluded area. It seems like most of the tables in the restaurant are this special with the exceptions of a few regular tables up front. Our group of 4 was quite comfortable in there, but 6 would have been fine as well. 

We ordered some much needed cold sake (long day with the little ones) and our very informative waiter told us about the specials. They all sounded good- the soft shell crab special at the top of the list. We decided to order the chefs choice (there was a fancier name for it) and there was some sort of deal where you could share as a couple. Fortunately, my husband shares my taste in sushi. We also added a few specials. 

Our 10+ course meal of small bites could not have been more delicious. By the end we wanted more, but mostly cause the food was so good. We added a sushi roll which was probably the most disappointing part of the meal but still good. And then of course dessert - green tea ice cream and creme brle. 

Highly recommend booking a res (or at least putting yourself on their waitlist) soon!

Best sushi experience in Chicago! Definitely get the omakase for $65. Add $5 more for uni if you are into that. I actually think you can share two omakase with three people. Pace yourself - The sashimi comes at the end and by then I'm always so full! 

Make reservations ahead of time and enjoy!

Kai Zan was on my list for almost two years and finally got a chance tonight. First of all, make a reservation, at least 2 weeks in advance. This is not a big place, and full of people all the time. We planned to order both regular premium omakase to get a full experience, unfortunately they didn't have premium. So we got a regular omakase, uni wrap(special for that night), scallop and cha siu skewers, stir fried soba.
 
Omakase: a 10 course chef choice. A great way for those new to KaiZan to try their highlight dishes. Lots of food, so be prepared. 
Uni wrap: $28 night special, uni+tuna+egg+nori= worth every penny! 
Skewers: Both Hotate and ChaSiu are good. ChaSiu is a must try! I usually don't like fatty stuff, but the pork fat here tastes just like heaven. 
Stir fried soba: The only dish I didn't enjoy. Taste bland and not in good presentation. The dish came out without edge being cleaned, it was really not a pleasant thing to see onions and sauces all over the plate. I understand it must be a busy, but people eat with eyes. 
Overall we had a great night in KaiZan, looking forward to try their premium omakase.

Amazing experience at Kai Zan for a birthday celebration! The service was top notch before we even set foot into the restaurant, with the hostesses being accommodating about our wanting to celebrate a birthday as well as reminding us to reserve a premium omakase set if we were interested. 

We shared one premium and one regular omakase, and it was a perfect way to try the many, many, many amazing things that Kai Zan had to offer. The flavors were excellent and ingredients were so fresh, with the fish and meats just oozing the perfect fatty flavors. The wagyu nigiri from the premium omakase was at the top of our favorites list, along with the "chip and dips" and the raw shooters. 

Thank you to the Kai Zan staff for a wonderful experience to taste the incredible flavors you guys have created!

While the food was good (most dishes were very tasty and a few were just OK) this place is definitely overrated. The stress of being here on time and only having 90 minutes at the table just isn't relaxing. It feels as if there is a countdown timer the entire time you are there.

I would definitely give the omakase a try if this is your first time here. The two of us tried the chef's choice omakase $65 and the premium omakase $115 (both were 10 courses each). The menu didn't overlap at all and really gave us a well-rounded tour of what they had to offer. Next time, I would probably order a la carte now that we know what our favorites are!

I'd say the best part of the premium omakase was the plate of fatty belly sashimi towards the end - omgosh fatty tuna belly, fatty salmon belly, fatty sea bass belly. SO BUTTERY. Also, the fatty imported Japanese wagyu nigiri. See photos - really top notch! The Madai carpaccio with basil was also solid.

The chef's choice omakase was printed on a menu, so it was much easier to remember what was what. Anyways, here are some of my favorites from the chef choice omakase:

Tuna and escolar pearls - the escolar pearls were better than the tuna ones
Scallop shooters - very fresh scallops and bright tasting!
Orange rush
Fiesta Maki - lots of fresh fish crammed into the roll, very yummy

What we would NOT get:
Tako yaki - such a disappointment, the outside was not crispy and the inside was very chewy.
Dynamite mussels - was ok but not great.
Angry crab - bland, no taste, I couldn't even tell there was crab inside!
Probably all of the skewers. The pork belly one was dry and meh.

Overall, we'd come back and order just our favorites and the uni! They didn't have any the night we went, so we'd definitely order some uni shooters or handrolls.

Went here with a bunch of foodie babes and had a delicious blast! The chef had a special menu prepared for us and I just loved everything! I mean no questions asked, just tasted everything they put in front of me and I loved it all!

What was my favorite you ask? Well any of the uni dishes of course!

What an unexpected find! I was visiting Chicago for the weekend and a friend recommended this as her absolute fave sushi spot. As a New Yorker and someone who eats sushi daily I took her up on it!

The omakase was phenomenal- creative and tasty. Our group was 6 so they actually recommended we get 3 omakase to share (they increased each course to 6 pieces) and also ordered some popular items on the menu. To me the winners were the polenta bites (with fried kale!) and the Madai with olive oil. I didn't love the scallop shooters as much as I though I would. 

Service was on point and I'm pretty sure we stayed beyond the allotted timeframe given we were a larger group.

Would definitely return next time I'm in Chicago'
