Ambiance was great, and so were the cocktails!  Overall the food was delicious, but there were some things we liked more than others. Meatballs, porchetta, and white fish were all top notch, and highly recommended!  Mac and cheese, and brussel sprouts for sides - yum!  We were looking forward to the pork chop, but it ended up being on the dry side, wouldn't order that again.

My husband and i went here last night. They were closing soon but accomodated us. I ordered the meatloaf which was out of this world! This entree even pours enough gravy which was so amazing tasting I asked for me! My husband got the truffle Mac with lobster...this was awesome as well- he devoured it. Lenny the chef came out and we were chatting with him for a bit. Not only is the staff extremely welcoming and kind but the food was insane good!!! I plan to Be back with friends. We had such a great time and no one rushed us even tho they were close to closing. My husband had met the owner about a month prior and they had not open yet- he came outside to greet my husband and talked to him
About the restaurant. My husband is also in the hospitality business and said he was the nicest guy. They def have our business. We were fans of Jane's that was there before and sad they closed but after last night we are past it ;) GREAT JOB!!!!

Since it's opening a few weeks ago we have been to this new neighborhood gem 4 times. We've tried almost everything on the menu and the food is just great. Chef greets customers with a smile and oversees that his moms' recipes are prepared as if she were watching over his shoulder. (We heard on occasion she has.) The abundant staff is very friendly and professional with their crisp, smart white shirts. The redesign of the space is nicely done and has a really warm and inviting feeling. If you eat at the bar the service is just as good and the bar staff is friendly too. Prices are reasonable and experience keeps us coming back.

This place has it figured out. The food, service, and atmosphere are perfect for the area - casual yet sophisticated. They start you off with delicious locally made rolls with an orange butter which signals a great meal to be had. Everything we had was delicious with favorites being the lamb chops with a jus that we just had to dip fries in because licking the plate would've been the only other option, the Brussels sprouts were perfectly crispy, and the chop chop salad had great combo of veggies.  Our server, Sean, was very helpful even dividing and portioning the dishes for us to share. When he told us it was their third day open, we were surprised as usually places that new have some more kinks to work out. Definitely a delightful neighborhood restaurant.

I am so delighted that this gem has come to our neighborhood! We went there for dinner on Friday night and loved everything about it. The service was exceptional and the proprietor came and introduced himself which we really appreciated. We had the steak (delicious and perfectly prepared!), the lemon chicken (Yum!), and the tasty pork chop. We had the mac & cheese which was also outstanding. The only so-so dish was the hash browns as the flavors didn't really blend. We were given a complimentary dessert at the end and this creme brulee was the best I have ever had. I can't wait to go back! The ambiance was also lovely although it got a little chilly near the door. As winter progresses, they'll want to add one of those wind-blocking external doors so that diners near the front can stay toasty. So glad this restaurant is here, it's our new favorite.

The design is meh but still somehow warm and comfortable. The service was great. The busboys actually asked if we needed anything and how our food was. So refreshing. The food was fantastic. Pork chops were turbo juicy and flavorful. Like as in the best I've ever had. Was NOT expecting that type of quality! I had bites of the steak and great too. My only legitimate complaint is that they have no business serving that bread pudding dessert without insisting the gentlemen put on a precautionary condom.

Mable's Table made me and my two girlfriends feel at home as soon as we walked in. It was cozy, dimly lit but not too dark, and had cute decor. It was perfect for the cold weather. We started off with their bread rolls and homemade butter which was delicious. We then ordered a bottle of wine. The waitress let us try a sample since they were out of the one that we originally wanted. The wine that she suggested was great. The mussels and frites were amazing, especially the sauce that it came with. The sauce was so good that we kept it to use for the other entrees. We split the cauliflower and chicken. The cauliflower with cheese on top (I think Parmesan) was so good. The chicken was a huge portion so I'm glad that we shared. It was incredible! Then we ended with the bread pudding which, again, was amazing. Everything from start to finish was delicious and didn't disappoint. The waitress was sweet and funny and the chef even came to introduce himself and thanked us for coming. I would definitely recommend to friends in the neighborhood!

We had a great night at Mable's Table, the food was delicious, the service was impeccable and the atmosphere is cozy and comfortable. We were hoping we would enjoy our experience as we are looking for a new neighborhood place with a versatile menu with great food, and we found it. We had the Lamb Chops, Porchetta, Cauliflower and Potatoes, all prepared perfectly. While we sat at a table, we also look forward to going back and sitting at the bar, great crowd.

I'm not giving Mabel's Table 5 stars because the food was amazing --but because it's such a lovely example of what it clearly intends to be: a casual dining spot with somewhat elevated comfort food and a comfortable, somewhat elevated atmosphere.  Just the place to meet friends for a bite before the theater, have a drink, and feel like you are having a treat.  The service definitely adds to the sense of being indulged: it's warm, considerate,  and somehow makes you feel like an honored guest without pretentiousness or fuss.  The menu isn't extensive--but its very well thought out, with something for every appetite and most every food restriction.  Everything was well prepared and well seasoned--with a bit of a flair. Entre portions  are reasonable and the vegetable sides were wonderfully generous and tasty--more than enough to share with the table.  Prices seemed on point with what was offered.  The real stand-out  was the crab and truffle mac and cheese. Cheesy, creamy and perfect.  Wine was reasonable-and if not the most generous pour--it was fine.  The staff made it a point to time the meal to our theater tickets (the Trap Door theater is just through a side door).  Coffee was fresh and good and desserts were also generous, pretty, and indulgent.  All in all, a very good place for an evening out.

Great new addition to the neighborhood. The interiors are beautiful, warm and welcoming. Food was excellent and service was good. They are in a great place for only being open for 12 days.
