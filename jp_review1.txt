Shhhhh....Psst!  I have a secret to tell you: This is "Da Bestest Sushi in Chicago!"  Truthfully, I am reluctant to share their GREAT review because it is already so hard to get reservations.    But it's about my peeps! my fans! about YOU!  not me :) .   

So let's be real, there are many good to okay sushi places in Chicago.   
                                                                                                             
    But often they are a forgettable experience.                               
                                                                                                        
PG-13 review warning :    C'mon now, we're talking about raw fish; often not much to the flavor profile to distinguish itself from other places.    So often with sushi places is the D-Test (the question about raw fish), did I get sick afterwards (D test , as in Diarrhea :) or not?!!) .      Obviously the bad places means bad fish ......

Back to Kai Zan:
 The creativity, the rice, the sauces, the taste, the combinations and the service.    Mmm, mmm GREAT.   Had the omakase prix fixed menu @ $65 each.   Reasonable. Yummy. Quickly served.     Tues and Weds they have an early bird special for $35 each.                                        Be sure to note the address because signage is very hard to see.   But like some other top places (Alinea), poor signage doesn't matter because so many people go there already or look for it!                           ................So remember this place is our little secret !

Hands down my favorite Japanese place in town. Having been in Chicago for four years, somehow I have never been to Kai Zan, but this visit completely wowed me. 

We sat at the bar seats and got to see how the chefs prepared for each course. I would highly recommend getting the omakase (or the premium one if you have tried the original omakase but wanted more high end / sophisticated raw materials to start with). Food is served to you in a super organized structure, and you won't experience a long gap or need to wait between two courses for sure. 

My favorite dish would probably be the uni tartare that's off the omakase menu. The uni has a super rich, satisfying texture - wrapping the tartare in the crunchy seaweed adds another layer to it! Within the omakase menu, the first couple of appetizers are simply amazing. The last couple of main dishes could be a bit salty. 

Overall, great experience and I'll be back again! This restaurant is definitely on par with momotaro, if not better. Also, remember to get the lava cake!! I love Japanese desserts and the lava cake here paired with black sesame ice cream will wrap up your dinner pretty well, and send you home with a happy tummy. :)

From quality to presentation, this restaurant was phenomenal. We had the premium omakase and the regular omakase to compare, and the premium one was definitely higher quality. I loved how not only do the dishes taste good, their creativity really shined through as well. Service was great too, our server explained every dish in detail, and even the sushi chef would ask us from time to time how we liked everything. There are 10 dishes to each omakase and I listed the prices below. We would return in the future... 

Price: Premium omakase is $120 
Regular omakase is $65.

As many reviews already stated, "Best sushi ever" given the ingredients that we had it was the best quality ever. We ended up having both the premium and regular omakase. Both were amazing but wouldn't be something to be doing all the time. Both Omakase was a 10 course meal each and both had amazing ingredients. But each shined in its own perspective. Starting with the premium we had to reserve it ahead of time along with put reservation to ensure we get one. The ingredients were high scale and tasted amazing. This contained stuff such as wagyu beef, blue fin tuna, applewood smoked yellowtail, and etc. As for the regular one it was more tasteful since it contained more fish for half the price. Overall worth trying each one first.

Tasty sushi but I feel like it's for more first time sushi eaters. 

I recommend making reservations because this place fills up fast. We decided with the $65 omakase with the $5 uni toppings. 

I thought all the sushi and sashimi were amazing and loved everything from it. The shooters were the best part! The carpaccio was flavorful and bomb. The cooked stuff was just aight and nothing memorable. I also didn't like how fast our food was coming out for an omakase experience! 

The service was excellent and very attentive. 

For my next visit, I'll try the premium omakase!

Splendid experience, 100% recommend! We ordered the Chef's Choice Omakase & it is definitely the way to go!

You will have a perfectly coursed out meal that is truly DELICIOUS, diverse & so, so fresh! The $65 price tag seems fair (and maybe even cheap) considering the quality of food & thought put into the creation of the meal!

After every course, my husband and I had a new favorite dish! It got better and better as it went. While each dish is a smaller-bite sized portion, there are enough dishes & spaced out nicely that you really do leave satisfied. 

Pair your meal with some of the plentiful sake or wine options & you have the recipe for a great night out! I absolutely plan on coming back and trying out the Premium Omakase!

Had an early reservation. Everything was great. Did the omakase as suggested by our server. Added the uni with the $5.00 addition. The meal did not disappoint. We left happy and satisfied. The only thing I can mention is that towards the middle of our meal, we felt they were rushing service as they obviously had a second seating after us. 
We were also seated by the bar which was awesome as we had the culinary view. It would have been nice if we could have lingered but I do understand that they have to flip  tables.

The quality of the ingredients, the spectacular presentation of the dishes, and the relaxing atmosphere makes Kai Zan one of the best restaurants in Chicago. 

I went with a group of four and we were seated in one of their private booths.  Our server was friendly and made some great recommendations.  The 10 course Omakase is around $65 and is well worth it.  I'm personally new to seafood and didn't want to commit to my own Omakase so our server had suggested that I join my husband's for an additional $15.  We shared most of the courses and the courses that were meant to be enjoyed as single bites (ex: angry crab), they brought out an additional "bite" for me.   

In addition to the Omakase we also ordered all three of the daily specials.  If you're there and they have Wagyu, go for it!   It was $10 per piece but it was well worth it.   Their taro chip special was great too, it reminded me of ceviche. 

If you like seafood, I suggest the Omakase.  If you're on the fence like me, skip the Omakase and order  la carte.  Although I enjoyed most of the courses, I couldn't stomach the oyster shooters and didn't enjoy the orange rush (sushi scallops wrapped in salmon).   Again, I didn't enjoy these dishes because I don't love seafood, not because they weren't good.   

If you only get one thing, let it be the Escolar pearls.  It's quite easily one of my favorite dishes of all time! 

Tips: It's BYOB (limit of 2 bottles)
         It's popular (make your reservations in advance)
         Go with a group (So you can be seated in a private booth)

Last week was my 3rd time coming to Kai Zan for their omikase menu and once again, they did not disappoint. This is probably one of the best Japanese cuisines in Chicago. 

First, I cannot stress enough to make reservations. The restaurant is quite small so if you walk in, it may not be possible to get a table. When you do make a reservation, they only allow for your party to sit for 1.5 hours. This allows for them to turn the table over for the next guest. If you make a reservation with a larger party, they will likely take your credit card information.

Now the food. You can order the omikase menu or you could choose to order off the regular menu. I definitely have to come back and order the normal menu. Do not fear the omikase. The chef/staff will work with you if there are certain things you don't like or have allergies. They were able to tailor the menu for me so that I didn't miss out on the goodness. Out of the 10 items, my favorite were the escolar pearls. They will render you speechless. They lightly torch the escolar and give it a smoky flavor. To top it off, the pearls are accompanied with an amazing truffle soy sauce. I could just order a plate of those. The crab wrapped in raw tuna, sushi, sashimi and hot dishes were also amazing. Some of the 10 dishes may be small, but don't let that fool you. I could not even finish my 10rh course!

Needless to say, you don't have to twist my arm to come back here!

This is one of those places I have yearned to try for a few years and I have either had plans canceled or was just plain lazy or could not find a reservation within the time frame I would like to eat. Well that has all come to an end now!!!!

I got the chance to come by this past Tuesday with a 7pm reservation with my very good friend. Not the biggest place but very nice looking and a bit fancier than your normal sushi joint. We were lucky enough to get one of the booths which was awesome. Our server was pretty much on point and basically walked us through the best option which was about 10 courses for $65 each...done!!!! To try so much for $65 at this place is a helluva deal!

Started out with the Madai Carpaccio (Japanese red snapper, basil, olive oil and black tobiko) and it was a nice starter and we both enjoyed.

Next up was the escolar and maguro rolls with truffle oil which were very good..actually we were like wow we should stop here if it gets better than this. 

Angry Crab was next as its basically spicy crab wrapped in tuna  with spicy mayo and tempura...pretty decent.

The Shooters were pretty nice as they came in the form of a shot and they included oysters and scallops, quail egg, black tobiko, ponzu sauce, scallions and tobasco....woooo that was good. Probably the best 4 shots I've ever taken.

Orange Rush was next and it was seared scallops and salmon which was good

Tuna Dashi was amazing and a break in the action. It was a broth with shitake mushrooms, little neck clams and tuna....It was very good and flavorful AF

Main Dish was tako wasabi, shrimp and pork belly on a stick...good...the wasabi was nice!

Fiesta Maki was good and had a bit of a spice to it

Dynamyte Mussels were definitely dynamite as they included scallion mayo, black tobiko and masago...very good flavor...probably the best mussels I've had!

Assorted Sashimi closed out the courses and it was very good.

I washed it all down with a 2016 Summer Water rose'...2 glasses did the trick. My buddy had a blanc and he said it was one of the best he has had. 

This place was well worth my 5 year wait to try it out and is now my favorite sushi place in the city! Multiple visits will probably be made within the next few months!

Great spot for wonderful sashimi with good service... Had the chefs choice omakase which was a really great value considering the quantity and quality of fish.  All the courses were imaginative and /or beautifully presented, but in terms of flavor the first couple courses were definitely my favorites (madai carpaccio & escolar/maduro pearls).  

We also had the full dessert menu (hey it was a group, stop judging- even though the waiter totally did :).  The mochi cake was the only one I didn't care for, the rest ranged from yum (chocolate cake) to interesting (matcha creme brle)

We had one of the private booths that was really roomy for a group of 4 and the service was efficient...  

Overall definitely plan to head back, perhaps try the premium omakase or other items off the menu...

Now I know why people are always raving about this place! We were finally able to snag a table here for my birthday dinner. The area is pretty quiet and from the outside at night it's a bit hard to find. I was told it's small and no joke it is. 
 
Our reservation was on a Saturday night at 8pm. Got there on time and only had to wait 4 minutes four our table. The restaurant gives you an option to either buy drinks from them or bring your own bottle for 12 dollars corkage fee. We opted to drink the wine we brought. The hubs was a bit reluctant to do the omakase thinking it might be too much food. The omakase was 10 dishes so like 2 from each section of the menu. Either way, I was dead set on doing the tasting. Needless to say he realized his wife is right. 

We ordered the regular omakase instead of the premium one. I believe the premium has uni and foie gras. We noticed the omakase was a popular option. It doesn't hurt it only costs 65 bucks. Much cheaper than other places would charge. Each dish was delicious! If you're a slow eater like me beware since the dishes come out fast! We were impressed by their efficiency. I could've done without the Angry Crab. It just didn't stand out. The sashimi was like butter in your mouth. The red snapper carpaccio was a dish I would order 20 times over. We really enjoyed the oyster shooter and how the flavors complimented each other. All of the dishes were great just minus the angry crab. 

The service was wonderful and on point. We were lucky to sit in front of the kitchen allowing us to watch each dish come together. We did order the chocolate lava cake as our dessert. The black sesame ice cream blew us away. The flavor of the ice cream was just a tad sweet but had a great berry flavor as well. Skip the cake and just get the ice cream instead. Overall, my high expectations for Kai Zan was met. We are already planning to come back for the premium omakase.

Considering I love nothing more than raw fish it's a shame it took me so long to get here. Small restaurant + melt-in-your--mouth sushi = difficult to get a reservation. However, my friend put our names on a waitlist awhile ago and got a call the day before they had a table free up. And so we traded in our original Italian plans for for sushi. 

They had a perfect table waiting for us- our own little secluded area. It seems like most of the tables in the restaurant are this special with the exceptions of a few regular tables up front. Our group of 4 was quite comfortable in there, but 6 would have been fine as well. 

We ordered some much needed cold sake (long day with the little ones) and our very informative waiter told us about the specials. They all sounded good- the soft shell crab special at the top of the list. We decided to order the chefs choice (there was a fancier name for it) and there was some sort of deal where you could share as a couple. Fortunately, my husband shares my taste in sushi. We also added a few specials. 

Our 10+ course meal of small bites could not have been more delicious. By the end we wanted more, but mostly cause the food was so good. We added a sushi roll which was probably the most disappointing part of the meal but still good. And then of course dessert - green tea ice cream and creme brle. 

Highly recommend booking a res (or at least putting yourself on their waitlist) soon!

Best sushi experience in Chicago! Definitely get the omakase for $65. Add $5 more for uni if you are into that. I actually think you can share two omakase with three people. Pace yourself - The sashimi comes at the end and by then I'm always so full! 

Make reservations ahead of time and enjoy!

Kai Zan was on my list for almost two years and finally got a chance tonight. First of all, make a reservation, at least 2 weeks in advance. This is not a big place, and full of people all the time. We planned to order both regular premium omakase to get a full experience, unfortunately they didn't have premium. So we got a regular omakase, uni wrap(special for that night), scallop and cha siu skewers, stir fried soba.
 
Omakase: a 10 course chef choice. A great way for those new to KaiZan to try their highlight dishes. Lots of food, so be prepared. 
Uni wrap: $28 night special, uni+tuna+egg+nori= worth every penny! 
Skewers: Both Hotate and ChaSiu are good. ChaSiu is a must try! I usually don't like fatty stuff, but the pork fat here tastes just like heaven. 
Stir fried soba: The only dish I didn't enjoy. Taste bland and not in good presentation. The dish came out without edge being cleaned, it was really not a pleasant thing to see onions and sauces all over the plate. I understand it must be a busy, but people eat with eyes. 
Overall we had a great night in KaiZan, looking forward to try their premium omakase.

Amazing experience at Kai Zan for a birthday celebration! The service was top notch before we even set foot into the restaurant, with the hostesses being accommodating about our wanting to celebrate a birthday as well as reminding us to reserve a premium omakase set if we were interested. 

We shared one premium and one regular omakase, and it was a perfect way to try the many, many, many amazing things that Kai Zan had to offer. The flavors were excellent and ingredients were so fresh, with the fish and meats just oozing the perfect fatty flavors. The wagyu nigiri from the premium omakase was at the top of our favorites list, along with the "chip and dips" and the raw shooters. 

Thank you to the Kai Zan staff for a wonderful experience to taste the incredible flavors you guys have created!

While the food was good (most dishes were very tasty and a few were just OK) this place is definitely overrated. The stress of being here on time and only having 90 minutes at the table just isn't relaxing. It feels as if there is a countdown timer the entire time you are there.

I would definitely give the omakase a try if this is your first time here. The two of us tried the chef's choice omakase $65 and the premium omakase $115 (both were 10 courses each). The menu didn't overlap at all and really gave us a well-rounded tour of what they had to offer. Next time, I would probably order a la carte now that we know what our favorites are!

I'd say the best part of the premium omakase was the plate of fatty belly sashimi towards the end - omgosh fatty tuna belly, fatty salmon belly, fatty sea bass belly. SO BUTTERY. Also, the fatty imported Japanese wagyu nigiri. See photos - really top notch! The Madai carpaccio with basil was also solid.

The chef's choice omakase was printed on a menu, so it was much easier to remember what was what. Anyways, here are some of my favorites from the chef choice omakase:

Tuna and escolar pearls - the escolar pearls were better than the tuna ones
Scallop shooters - very fresh scallops and bright tasting!
Orange rush
Fiesta Maki - lots of fresh fish crammed into the roll, very yummy

What we would NOT get:
Tako yaki - such a disappointment, the outside was not crispy and the inside was very chewy.
Dynamite mussels - was ok but not great.
Angry crab - bland, no taste, I couldn't even tell there was crab inside!
Probably all of the skewers. The pork belly one was dry and meh.

Overall, we'd come back and order just our favorites and the uni! They didn't have any the night we went, so we'd definitely order some uni shooters or handrolls.

What an unexpected find! I was visiting Chicago for the weekend and a friend recommended this as her absolute fave sushi spot. As a New Yorker and someone who eats sushi daily I took her up on it!

The omakase was phenomenal- creative and tasty. Our group was 6 so they actually recommended we get 3 omakase to share (they increased each course to 6 pieces) and also ordered some popular items on the menu. To me the winners were the polenta bites (with fried kale!) and the Madai with olive oil. I didn't love the scallop shooters as much as I though I would. 

Service was on point and I'm pretty sure we stayed beyond the allotted timeframe given we were a larger group.

Would definitely return next time I'm in Chicago'

What an unexpected find! I was visiting Chicago for the weekend and a friend recommended this as her absolute fave sushi spot. As a New Yorker and someone who eats sushi daily I took her up on it!

The omakase was phenomenal- creative and tasty. Our group was 6 so they actually recommended we get 3 omakase to share (they increased each course to 6 pieces) and also ordered some popular items on the menu. To me the winners were the polenta bites (with fried kale!) and the Madai with olive oil. I didn't love the scallop shooters as much as I though I would. 

Service was on point and I'm pretty sure we stayed beyond the allotted timeframe given we were a larger group.

Would definitely return next time I'm in Chicago'

How have I not already written a review of Kai Zan!
This is hands down my favorite sushi and fancy dining restaurant in Chicago.

This is the Uchi of Chicago with it's quality and artful dishes. A very intimate and personalized eating experience. You MUST get the omakase for $65 (one day, I'll splurge for the premium omakase!!) and treat yourself to the chef's delights. I've even took the omakase menu home so I can occasionally reminisce on these tasteful bites. NOTE: You have to make reservations which quickly fill up well in advance.

My most recent experience at Kai Zan, my boyfriend and I were seated at the bar right in front of the chefs for dinner and a show! Service is very attentive, friendly and happy to answer questions, explain each dish in detail or make accomodations. Also offered is an uni upgrade to the shooters dish

The omakase included the Madai Carpaccio, Escolar & Maguro pearls, Angry Crab (sushi bite)
Oyster and Scallop shooters (yum!), Orange Rush (scallop bite), Tuna Dashi (subtle but delicious soup), Main (bites of shrimp, char siu, tako yaki octupus ball, and tako wasabi salad), Fiesta Maki (sushi roll), Dynamyte Mussels, and a Sashimi assortment - my kind of dessert!  

Literally no complaints. Even as a repeat customer, I'm consistently impressed with their creativity and commitment to the art of sushi. Perfect for special occasions for your loved ones.

This place has mastered it all. Hands down rockstar across the board.  Still thinking about the food days after, service impeccable.  Atmosphere very cool.   Did I say food!?!  Escolar pearls.  Pickled veggies.  Seriously.  

Shame on me for wanting to visit for two years and just going this week. My loss!

I really cannot find anything wrong with this place because not only was the service superb, but the food was also delicious. 

My friend and I both got the basic omakase for $65 and then we added the option of adding uni to two of the courses for an additional 5$, which was uh SO WORTH IT. MY FAVORITE COURSE OF THE EVENING was either the oyster and scallop shooters or the sashimi. 

The only reason I am taking off a star is because my friend and I both felt that the sashimi was so so so fresh that it should be set as one of the beginning courses and not dead last. We were so full by the time the sashimi came that we couldn't fully enjoy it like we would've wanted. Honestly, we would have rather they taken out the cooked the "main" course if that meant we were slightlier hungrier and could savor our raw fish completely. 

My last piece of advice if you are considering coming here is that this place is very very Americanized omakase. Coming from LA, and having extremely authentic sushi may have ruined me but if that's what you are also used to then I would be weary of coming here. It won't satisfy your raw fish nigiri style craving. But still incredibly yummy!

Made a same week reservation and secured a 4:30pm dinner reservation for Saturday. I was a bit put off by the time we were given. I was thinking to myself is that considered dinner or a late lunch? But I really wanted to treat my bf to omakase for our 4 year anniversary so took it anyways. After all, it's my fault to making the last minute reservation. We tried the chef's menu and premium menu. The chef's menu is $65 for 10 courses. The premium menu is double the price with the same number of courses, but not twice the quality. For some reason, they don't print out the premium menus either. I would stick to the chef's menu. Food was fresh and delicious; a great value for omakase style. It's easily one of the better Japanese restaurants in the city. My favorites were the escolar & maguro pearls (2nd) and fiesta maki (8th). On the premium menu, the most memorable items were the fresh wasabi where the wasabi is cut up in tiny chunks, and the dessert which was ice-cream with passion fruit pure and crumble. If I'm paying $120 for a multi-course meal and stating the most memorable items being a condiment and ice-cream, I think it's safe to conclude it just didn't blow me away. To sum up the experience, we were running 5 minutes late, and when I called to let them know, I was told we had 90 minutes to finish and we might not get seated if we don't get there soon. A friend of mine who went recently said she had 2 hours to eat, so it's not the case everyday. Perhaps it's just a Saturday thing since there're more diners so they have to be rigid in sticking to the schedule. The staff choreographed beautifully in bringing out the dishes and taking them away promptly, but we felt rushed. The bill was handed to us at 6pm sharp. They asked if I was celebrating a special occasion the day before when they called to confirm my reservation. I told them my anniversary. When dinner was done, we ordered a dessert (additional one outside of the omakase meals), but there was no effort put into decorating the dessert, and we ended up paying for it. I'll admit that I'm used to restaurants now waving the cost of the dessert for special occasions or at lease decorating it, but either way, why ask me if I'm celebrating anything if they don't plan on doing anything for the guests? We walked out a little after 6pm and it was still bright. It was the strangest feeling since that's normally when dinner starts. 

Warning: make your reservations a month early for those coveted weekend dinner seats, or get stuck with a late lunch time like what I had.

What can I say...after living a block away from here for years (sadly no longer) and having been here five times, I am not sure why it took me this long to write a review. Let's just say: Kai Zan is top notch. The quality of the food is stellar, the atmosphere is intimate, and service has always been outstanding. I have heard people come in and complain they have to sit at the bar and it always baffles me: 1.) it says on their reservations page this may occur 2.) they tell you this when they call to confirm your reservation, and 3.) it is actually pretty cool to watch the guys at work prepare your food.

Some highlights from the menu for me include the Orange Rush (I could probably get 10 orders of just these and be very satisfied), the maguro pearls, and the Madai carpaccio (absolutely outstanding). We tried Potato Ohitashi this past visit for something different and it was SO good, plus a little more filling. For dessert, their green tea ice cream is very good (creamy, not very sweet) as are their mochis (love the Japanese pumpkin flavor they had during our most recent visit)

My only complaint is the 1.5 hour time limit (we tend to make later reservations so we don't feel rushed), based on the space and the popularity, I understand why they do it; however, the one time we chose to do the Omakase I personally felt a bit rushed. 

That all said, I can't wait to get my next five visits on the books!!

It wasn't before long till I had to come back for the Omakase. It was as good as last time, if not better. The chefs also gave us a complimentary piece!

One thing I would highly recommend - pay $5 to add uni to some of your dishes. In our case, it was the the scallop shooter, the angry crab, and the dynamyte mussel. The angry crab was sooo mindbogglingly delicious with the uni added on top. We were going to get the uni toro tartare appetizer, but ended up being too full by the time we moved to the dashi on the Omakase menu. 

We also did not mind eating at 4:30pm. We chose to sit at the sushi bar and had so much fun watching the chefs work their magic, especially when they were cracking 30 quail eggs into those shooters. It was such a great dining experience for an unbeatable price. I am already planning my next trip there.

I feel like everyone is going to hate me on this one but I think Kai Zan is over rated. Great service, I love the intimate private booths, but I just couldn't get over how unimpressed I was. I came here with a group of friends and we all ordered Omakase. Maybe I can give this place another shot and order off the regular menu. Some dishes were better than others.

This was from a little while ago - 
When we first arrived, we had to wait a bit to be seated. Not a problem, everyone was busily tending their duties. My friend and I both got the premium omakase. Compared to traditional omakase, Kai Zen's serves up a fusion between the west and Japanese food. I personally enjoy traditional omakase more (there were few dishes that confused me, especially a deconstructed pie for dessert), but my friend loved it! Overall a great experience, and would visit again. Next time I'll probably stick with sashimi only.

I love Kai Zan. Seriously I love love LOVE this place. I came here for the first time about a year ago and I still can't get enough. Sure there's some pretty stiff / delicious sushi competition out there, buttttttt Kai Zan is easily 110% the BEST sushi in Chicago! 

The menu is simple. Small plates and a handful of roll and plate options. On a typical visit I always start with the seaweed salad and the mind blowing dynamite mussels. If you get a bar seat you get to watch them prep the mussels and torch them to perfection. It's definitely a plus. 

When it comes to dinner items, there have been some stand out menu specials in the past. Always go for a special roll! Some were so good that each time I come back I pray that they have them on menu again (*cough* lobster maki *cough* tuna belly roll cough*).

In terms of the larger meals I tried the Omakase dinner about two months ago. Seriously each item was better than the last. They devilishly ended our meal with a sashimi tray for the final course. Um the tray had at least three different types of tuna. GET OUT OF HERE it was so amazing. Oh Kai Zan you have my heart I'll definitely be back!

So I booked a trip to Chicago as a surprise for my wife on Mother's Day. The main purpose of our trip was to eat our way through chicago. We're both sushi snobs and have eaten omakase everywhere.  So we arrived in Chicago from Houston today. And took out uber with our 9 month old son to the restaurant. On the way there, I called to tell them I was running 15 mins. They told me no problem and that the kitchen hood was messed up so they could only make cold items which was okay I guess. On our last trip to Chicago, we are here twice we liked it so much. So this time around, we were super excited and had our list ready to order. 2 blocks before we got to the restaurant, they called and said they're closing the restaurant due to issues.  I asked for a reschedule Sunday or Monday but unfortunately, they're closed those days and we have to return to Houston on Monday. 

So my wife and I and our 9 month old son are kinda bitter and pissed. I showed up. We explained our whole situation. The owner and sushi chef came out and was super understanding and apologetic. We showed him our list on our phone of the items we wanted to order and he determined what he could and couldn't make. We waited and he came back with two bags of to go. 

He even comped it because we had to take. $25 uber there and $20 back. We felt better but we're still not satisfied because we didn't get our full menu of everything we wanted. We tipped $20 and left. 

We're now back at the hotel and even to-go, this is the hands-down best sushi restaurant in the USA. 


Order these items below. The chef made us what he could have an it was to die for. My pictures don't do their sushi ANY justice. Try this place. We literally booked a trip from houston just to eat here because we love it that much.

I'm from Chicago and a big foodie and I've heard tons of hype. And I'm happy to say this place lives up to it!

-modern and trendy, but still intimate atmosphere (definitely great for a date you want to look impressive on)
-we sat at the bar which I think was best spot--could see all the action and got to talk to the two owners and get their recs!
-sushi was absolutely delicious--I'm salivating just thinking about it
-lots of uni dishes--and it was fantastic and fresh uni 
-beautiful presentation--very artfully done

Definitely have to go back soon!

A cozy little Japanese restaurant in Logan Sq.  The Omakase menu showcases the breadth of their menu so it is worth to try.  For a few additional dollars they will upgrade the Omakase with Uni - definitely go for it! We sat by the bar fronting the kitchen so apart from the decadent array of delicious seafood, we get to watch Melvin & Carlo perform their craft. What a great experience overall!

Not much to say here except that this was the best meal I've had in a couple years!  Just go there and get the Chef's Okakase, don't even look at the menu.  Everything from presentation to quality to flavor is top notch.. I mean 5 star BID!  Inside is definitely cool with some semi-private booths on the one side/ sushi bar on the other.  Service was great and I like the fact that the waiters/ waitresses switch off.. so if you don't like the first waiter don't be discouraged!  Definitely one the best sushi joints in Chicago.. talk later PS- Don't forget the chocolate lava cake with black sesame ice cream! Mind blowing

Come here for the Omakase...& if you're an uni lover like me, then you will for sure love it!

Also, if your order the omakase, just be prepared to eat a lot of food. By the end of it I actually couldn't even finish my sashimi because I was so full. 

Some of my favorites were the seared maguro & escolar, angry crab & shooters.

Nice ambiance for a date night, & definitely recommend making reservations ahead of time.

Just five years ago, I didn't have the most refined palate.

My sushi tastes consisted of shrimp tempura rolls, fancy rolls with a lot of aioli, or normal rolls doused in soy sauce. 

Raw fish topped with rice? Bleh.
Sashimi? Double Bleh.

I like to call these "the dark days." 

Fast forward to now and me and the bf are looking for "the best sushi in Chicago."

A quick google search brought me to Kai Zan.

I was trying to make a reservation for a Friday night on a Wednesday and the earliest that they had was 10PM. We took it and we were ready to go. 

Friday night, we found ourselves on a long drive out to West Town. We definitely drove past the restaurant and weren't even convinced we had the address til we took a closer look at the place. But we walked in and the ambiance was very cozy. There were some private booths to the left, but we were immediately seated at the sushi bar in the room to the right.

I knew that we had to get the Omakase. How were we going to find "the best sushi in Chicago" if we didn't try the best of the best?

The waitress explained the regular Omakase was $65 and the Premium or Chef's Choice Omakase was $115 so we opted for the Premium.

She came back a little while later to tell us that since it was already so late, they wouldn't be able to do the Premium for us, so then we downgraded to the regular. I was a little bummed, but she did give us the option to add on uni for just a $5 upcharge. I'd never had uni before, so of course I said, "Sure, why not."

And you guys. This. Was. Amazing. I wish I had a list of everything we ate, but instead I took pictures because that's the type of person I am. 

We started with a bunch of raw dishes. One of my favorites was a quartet of fatty tuna that really just melted in my mouth. The plating was simple and thoughtful. I'm not a huge fan of oyster shooters, but the oyster/uni/scallop shooters that they had at Kai Zan tasted great and had a good kick. We got a plate of their "Fiesta Roll" which was probably the most boring part of the meal, really. The warm dishes were good (though tbh, we were already enthralled by the sushi). And we finished off the Omakase with a plate of delicious, high-quality sashimi.  

Now 20 year old Kevin would be cringing at the whole ordeal. But 25 year old Kevin? Thoroughly impressed.

We finished off the whole meal by ordering some Orange mochi and it was the perfect light way to end.

Overall, if that's what $65 bought me, I cannot even imagine what $115 buys you. Sushi wrapped in gold leaf? You get to take home your own goldfish? Mermaid sushi?

I just know that I HAVE to come back to have it. 

Do you like sushi?
Go to Kai Zan. Get the Omakase.

Do you not like sushi?
Give it another five years, kid. Then go to Kai Zan. Get the Omakase.

Kai Zan is my absolute, hands down, favorite sushi spot in all of Chicago. I literally dream of this place. Went with a friend for dinner and after setting a reservation we were kindly but firmly made aware of their reservation policy and it's a strict one so don't take them lightly and show up on time. Went with the Omakase and was not disappointed. Everything was so fresh and delicious, from the uni to the escarole. A true hidden gem in the city. Cannot wait to return

I'll admit it's hard to please a food snob like me, but the dining experience here was spectacular, from service to atmosphere to food. The fish was buttery, soft, and fresh. The omakase courses were all timed perfectly. The staff attentive without being overbearing. The menu was creative and cleverly deviated from the norm without going too far.

If it's your first time, you must get the chef's choice omakase for $65. This is the "tried and true" omakase that highlights the best and greatest of Kai Zan. It included:
- madai carpaccio with tobiko and basil miso (basil flavor a tad strong, but refreshing dish)
- escolar and maguro pearls (LOVE, wish i could've had more of this. the fish was just so delish)
- uni and scallop shooter with ponzu and quail egg (not my fav, but my bf liked it)
- angry crab and grilled scallop (unique takes on some common fish)
- misc hot foods such as shrimp, char siu, takoyaki (least favorite course, but it was nice to try the hot foods they offer here)
- dynamite mussel with black tobiko and negi mayo (small course, but yum!)
- fiesta maki (can't go wrong with sushi rolls esp if fish is as good as this)
- sashimi comes with yellowtail, tuna, escolar, salmon (soft and buttery yassssss)

We also HAD to get the uni toro tartare for $28 because it looked amazing. You're supposed to mix together everything and make the roll yourself. It ends up looking not very appetizing, almost like a gushy, yolky, slob of rice but OH MAN WAS IT BOMB. I'm especially picky about eating fresh uni and this place passed the test. Next time I'm back, I'm definitely getting 2 of these and no, I'm not sharing.

Can't recommend this place enough. Favorite restaurant in Chicago so far.

Omakase $65 worth. Came in at a 5 o clock reservation with my brother and his friend. They both knew they wanted omakase but I was hesitant.  I had read up on a couple of things that many people raved about, so naturally I wanted to try those. Asked the waiter if those things were on the menu and he promptly brought out the omakase menu (this is a plus). I saw many things I wanted to try on the menu so I thought to myself,  why not! 

Not to be some bougie ass stereotypical think-I-know-it-all-and-am-the-best girl from SoCal, but I know good sushi because I've had a good amount and because my brother is some sort of sushi connoisseur. I've had the good and the bad. Came into Kai Zan honestly not expecting that great, but l was pleasantly surprised. There were 10 courses and more than one course had more than one piece of sushi in it. The pearls came with two of each. The main had four different pieces, etc. My favorites were probably the Angry Crab, Orange Crush, and the oyster shooter.  All full of flavor, creative, and pleasing to the eye. Won't say too much since its definitely something you have to experience for yourself. Known to be one of the best in Chicago it is WORTH (although it ain't near a train stop, so you'll likely have to hop on the 66 and head hella west and they open during traffic hour so hella people on the 66)!!

The food was great, and so was the setting and service. The booths that they place you in are nice and private (not the bar). You get to pay attention tp the party you're in and don't have to shout at one another. Service is also absolutely wonderful - checking on you just enough, but not too much.

Kai Zan is what I love most about food in Chicago. You have an unassuming place off the beaten path with amazing food.

We had the omakase (courses selected by the chef) which I highly recommend. With 10 courses, I was excited to see what the next course would be. Each dish was creative and thoughtful. I appreciate that they take the time to explain each dish as they serve it. Everything was exquisite!  The service was also great which can be hard to find at sushi restaurants. This is hands down the best sushi I have had.

So I booked a trip to Chicago as a surprise for my wife on Mother's Day. The main purpose of our trip was to eat our way through chicago. We're both sushi snobs and have eaten omakase everywhere.  So we arrived in Chicago from Houston today. And took out uber with our 9 month old son to the restaurant. On the way there, I called to tell them I was running 15 mins. They told me no problem and that the kitchen hood was messed up so they could only make cold items which was okay I guess. On our last trip to Chicago, we are here twice we liked it so much. So this time around, we were super excited and had our list ready to order. 2 blocks before we got to the restaurant, they called and said they're closing the restaurant due to issues.  I asked for a reschedule Sunday or Monday but unfortunately, they're closed those days and we have to return to Houston on Monday. 

So my wife and I and our 9 month old son are kinda bitter and pissed. I showed up. We explained our whole situation. The owner and sushi chef came out and was super understanding and apologetic. We showed him our list on our phone of the items we wanted to order and he determined what he could and couldn't make. We waited and he came back with two bags of to go. 

He even comped it because we had to take. $25 uber there and $20 back. We felt better but we're still not satisfied because we didn't get our full menu of everything we wanted. We tipped $20 and left. 

We're now back at the hotel and even to-go, this is the hands-down best sushi restaurant in the USA. 


Order these items below. The chef made us what he could have an it was to die for. My pictures don't do their sushi ANY justice. Try this place. We literally booked a trip from houston just to eat here because we love it that much.

I'm from Chicago and a big foodie and I've heard tons of hype. And I'm happy to say this place lives up to it!

-modern and trendy, but still intimate atmosphere (definitely great for a date you want to look impressive on)
-we sat at the bar which I think was best spot--could see all the action and got to talk to the two owners and get their recs!
-sushi was absolutely delicious--I'm salivating just thinking about it
-lots of uni dishes--and it was fantastic and fresh uni 
-beautiful presentation--very artfully done

Definitely have to go back soon!

A cozy little Japanese restaurant in Logan Sq.  The Omakase menu showcases the breadth of their menu so it is worth to try.  For a few additional dollars they will upgrade the Omakase with Uni - definitely go for it! We sat by the bar fronting the kitchen so apart from the decadent array of delicious seafood, we get to watch Melvin & Carlo perform their craft. What a great experience overall!

Not much to say here except that this was the best meal I've had in a couple years!  Just go there and get the Chef's Okakase, don't even look at the menu.  Everything from presentation to quality to flavor is top notch.. I mean 5 star BID!  Inside is definitely cool with some semi-private booths on the one side/ sushi bar on the other.  Service was great and I like the fact that the waiters/ waitresses switch off.. so if you don't like the first waiter don't be discouraged!  Definitely one the best sushi joints in Chicago.. talk later PS- Don't forget the chocolate lava cake with black sesame ice cream! Mind blowing

Come here for the Omakase...& if you're an uni lover like me, then you will for sure love it!

Also, if your order the omakase, just be prepared to eat a lot of food. By the end of it I actually couldn't even finish my sashimi because I was so full. 

Some of my favorites were the seared maguro & escolar, angry crab & shooters.

Nice ambiance for a date night, & definitely recommend making reservations ahead of time.

Just five years ago, I didn't have the most refined palate.

My sushi tastes consisted of shrimp tempura rolls, fancy rolls with a lot of aioli, or normal rolls doused in soy sauce. 

Raw fish topped with rice? Bleh.
Sashimi? Double Bleh.

I like to call these "the dark days." 

Fast forward to now and me and the bf are looking for "the best sushi in Chicago."

A quick google search brought me to Kai Zan.

I was trying to make a reservation for a Friday night on a Wednesday and the earliest that they had was 10PM. We took it and we were ready to go. 

Friday night, we found ourselves on a long drive out to West Town. We definitely drove past the restaurant and weren't even convinced we had the address til we took a closer look at the place. But we walked in and the ambiance was very cozy. There were some private booths to the left, but we were immediately seated at the sushi bar in the room to the right.

I knew that we had to get the Omakase. How were we going to find "the best sushi in Chicago" if we didn't try the best of the best?

The waitress explained the regular Omakase was $65 and the Premium or Chef's Choice Omakase was $115 so we opted for the Premium.

She came back a little while later to tell us that since it was already so late, they wouldn't be able to do the Premium for us, so then we downgraded to the regular. I was a little bummed, but she did give us the option to add on uni for just a $5 upcharge. I'd never had uni before, so of course I said, "Sure, why not."

And you guys. This. Was. Amazing. I wish I had a list of everything we ate, but instead I took pictures because that's the type of person I am. 

We started with a bunch of raw dishes. One of my favorites was a quartet of fatty tuna that really just melted in my mouth. The plating was simple and thoughtful. I'm not a huge fan of oyster shooters, but the oyster/uni/scallop shooters that they had at Kai Zan tasted great and had a good kick. We got a plate of their "Fiesta Roll" which was probably the most boring part of the meal, really. The warm dishes were good (though tbh, we were already enthralled by the sushi). And we finished off the Omakase with a plate of delicious, high-quality sashimi.  

Now 20 year old Kevin would be cringing at the whole ordeal. But 25 year old Kevin? Thoroughly impressed.

We finished off the whole meal by ordering some Orange mochi and it was the perfect light way to end.

Overall, if that's what $65 bought me, I cannot even imagine what $115 buys you. Sushi wrapped in gold leaf? You get to take home your own goldfish? Mermaid sushi?

I just know that I HAVE to come back to have it. 

Do you like sushi?
Go to Kai Zan. Get the Omakase.

Do you not like sushi?
Give it another five years, kid. Then go to Kai Zan. Get the Omakase.

Kai Zan is my absolute, hands down, favorite sushi spot in all of Chicago. I literally dream of this place. Went with a friend for dinner and after setting a reservation we were kindly but firmly made aware of their reservation policy and it's a strict one so don't take them lightly and show up on time. Went with the Omakase and was not disappointed. Everything was so fresh and delicious, from the uni to the escarole. A true hidden gem in the city. Cannot wait to return

I'll admit it's hard to please a food snob like me, but the dining experience here was spectacular, from service to atmosphere to food. The fish was buttery, soft, and fresh. The omakase courses were all timed perfectly. The staff attentive without being overbearing. The menu was creative and cleverly deviated from the norm without going too far.

If it's your first time, you must get the chef's choice omakase for $65. This is the "tried and true" omakase that highlights the best and greatest of Kai Zan. It included:
- madai carpaccio with tobiko and basil miso (basil flavor a tad strong, but refreshing dish)
- escolar and maguro pearls (LOVE, wish i could've had more of this. the fish was just so delish)
- uni and scallop shooter with ponzu and quail egg (not my fav, but my bf liked it)
- angry crab and grilled scallop (unique takes on some common fish)
- misc hot foods such as shrimp, char siu, takoyaki (least favorite course, but it was nice to try the hot foods they offer here)
- dynamite mussel with black tobiko and negi mayo (small course, but yum!)
- fiesta maki (can't go wrong with sushi rolls esp if fish is as good as this)
- sashimi comes with yellowtail, tuna, escolar, salmon (soft and buttery yassssss)

We also HAD to get the uni toro tartare for $28 because it looked amazing. You're supposed to mix together everything and make the roll yourself. It ends up looking not very appetizing, almost like a gushy, yolky, slob of rice but OH MAN WAS IT BOMB. I'm especially picky about eating fresh uni and this place passed the test. Next time I'm back, I'm definitely getting 2 of these and no, I'm not sharing.

Can't recommend this place enough. Favorite restaurant in Chicago so far.

My friend recommended this place to me when I visiting so I came in at 5pm, 30mins after it opened not realizing how packed it already gets! Even though I didn't have a reservation, the hostess managed to fit me and my plus 1 in!

The food was incredible! Tried their octopus, scallop, and salmon rolls along with their Suki Slamon special and this special beef from Japan (sorry forgot the name!) and everything was cooked perfectly. The meat and fish just melted in your mouth, and had so much flavorful without being overwhelming. Our server Daniel was also super knowledgeable and was so great and honest with all his recommendations.

The place itself is a little small so it has this cozy, snug, intimate ambience. But they do have booths if you need to RSVP larger groups.

Great food and terrific service! I will definitely be back.

While I prefer eating at Yuzu down the street, the food quality at Kai Zan has the edge.  We tried the shishito peppers, the beef tataki, the edamame, the agedashi tofu, the Angry Crab, the Flaming Tuna, and the yaki soba noodles with pork.  I would get every dish again, and all of this came out to $65, the same price as the 10-course tasting meal, so you can pick your poison and do damage here to fill yourself up!

The space here is great, and while I like the energy at Yuzu more, for a date night, Kai Zan is the better choice (although the soundtrack at Kai Zan was just weird to me...the mix of music and movie soundtrack stuff I heard last night was wacky, right up to the point when the James Bond score/theme started playing.  WTF?).

Prices are fair and they have a good list of beer, wine and sake choices.  There is a corkage fee of $15 for two bottles if you bring your own.

Excited for my next visit!

15 corkage fee?!?  And a can of 200ML sake is $23 that probably costs $3 is purely a scam. I get markup of liquor being in the business but this was just a tad too steep in my eyes. 

The food is nothing more than great!  5 star worthy but I'm rating the overall experience. 

Omakase, please!!!!  The Madai carpaccio, Maduro pearls & orange rush were the top of the list.  The grand slam was the last and final course. Beautifully plated fresh sashimi that just melts in your mouth like budda!!!  Top 3 sashimi I've ever eaten in my life. The food is worth bragging about but you just need to be sober to enjoy it. :-)

Delicious! If Yelp had this option, I would give Kai Zan 5 flaming stars!! 

A week prior to our trip to Chicago, we were trying to put our itinerary together and was totally scrambling to make reservations at all the places we wanted to try. Somehow (counting our lucky stars), Kai Zen had one last available spot on Saturday at 10:00PM.

When we arrived, the host had seated us by the bar and we were able to see the chefs in action which was really cool.

The BF and I opted for the chef's choice omakase ($60 per person) + uni (additional $5), totally worth it. We also ordered an additional dish, DIY toro uni hand rolls ($28) which was AMAZING. My mouth just salivated a little bit thinking about it right now. If you are an uni lover, I highly recommend trying it.

I won't get into every detail about each omakase dish. However, I will say every dish was simple yet complex in flavor, everything we didn't expect to our taste buds to experience.

Overall, Kai Zan was a remarkable dining experience from great service, delicious food and affordable prices. It's a totally hidden gem in Chicago and needs to have more recognition. Let's just say, if we lived in Chicago, we would probably be here at least once a month. Trust me, it's that good!

This is my favorite "treat yoself" sushi places. The chefs do a beautiful job on presentation, creativity and taste with all their dishes.

We went with a group of four and did two premium and two regular omakase (tasting menu). They were both amazing! The premium is expensive but it's worth a try and/or to do it for a special occasion. I believe the regular omakase doesn't change too frequently (I remember some of the  dishes from doing it before) but the premium was such a fun experience. We got to try a lot of different new ingredients and combinations. I have provided pictures to give you an idea of how beautiful the food is.

The private seating is nice option to have when you go with a small group.

The service was great! The chefs came to greet us and were very personable.

The whole experience is one that I will not forget!

Another year goes by and it's already time for another birthday dinner. My bf pretty much tells me what type of cuisine he wants and I choose a restaurant I've been wanting to try. (Always a win for me!!) This place is a little small, but the decor is cool and casual. The hostess was nice and attentive. We were greeted as soon as we stepped in and my bf was wished a happy birthday. Luckily, we were seated at one of the booths, so we were able to stretch out and get comfortable. I am in love with uni, so I had to ask if they had it. I was surprised to hear that they did not have uni that day (it was a Thursday, btw). However, our server quickly remembered that there was a small amount of uni reserved only for the premium omakase. Well then, I guess I didn't really have a choice! I like to indulge, especially on special occasions, so I had to get the premium omakase. Service was a little bit rushed, in my opinion. Our dishes came out pretty quickly with barely any wait in between, which is fine. But, I do not appreciate my plate being cleared from the table when I'm still chewing and holding a piece of food in my chopstick! Jeesh.

Anyway, on to the premium omakase.. There were a total of 10 dishes and the last one was dessert. I understand the concept of omakase, but I wish I had a little take home menu to remember what in the world I was eating. You will just have to look at my pictures and their barebone captions. Sorry! This is not a traditional omakase with just sushi. They have a lot of interesting dishes that make up majority of the courses. The servers did a great job at explaining everything. All of our dishes had complex and thorough descriptions of the ingredients, which I love to hear about. The presentations were great and the dishes were full of contrasting flavors, colors and textures. The nigiri and sashimi quality were what I expected it to be. So delicate, soft and clean. The pickled wasabi relish was so spicy, but fun to use. By the end of our savory dishes, we were stuffed to the brim. It was definitely an enjoyable dinner. They even gave us an extra dessert with a candle for my bf's birthday. That was a nice touch! 

Overall, it was a good experience with great food. I will have to come back to try their regular omakase.

Kai Zan is definitely really good, but I don't think it totally lived up to our expectations.  Our waiter was super quirky.  He didn't seem like much of a people person, which makes being a server at a restaurant a weird fit.  Anyways, we opted for the Omakase and were surprised that the price was lower, but for more courses than most restaurants ($65). They totally can squeeze more outta customers for the quality but maybe because it's further out from the city it's lower priced.  

I want to say there were 10 courses.  All of the courses were great, unique and great flavor, but we were really really fished out by then end. And for me, that means there was a lot of fish because seafood is my favorite food (see all other reviews of mine... you'll get it). The last dish was a ton of sashimi (and it was fantastic), but by the time we got to dish 10 it was almost hard to eat all of it, which was a shame.  Every single dish was some sort of raw seafood, which is totally expected for a sushi restaurant.  However, many Omakase dinners we've gotten in the city have some variation (king crab soup, seafood "dumpling", ramen), which I think we like a little bit more. I think they could benefit from doing less courses and just giving you bigger portions as well.  

Overall the quality of the fish was stellar and everything tasted great, but just be prepared for a lot lot lot of raw fish.  You will have a great meal here though.

Excellent omakase. A lot of variety and creation, a lot of food as well (almost too much) for 65$ which is actually cheap considering the quality of the food and of the service. We also tried a creme brulee and it was delicious. Just be advised that most of the plates are spicy. Definitely would go back if I come back to Chicago :)

This place serves american style sushi (not traditional Japanese sushi). However, for 10-courses omakase plus complimentary chef creation for the first course at the price of $60, I can't complain, that's why I give it a 4 star rating.

My favorites are Madai Carpaccio and Shooters. The Tuna Dashi tastes like nothing more than salt water soup. The Fiesta Maki and Dynamite Mussels taste average (nothing special about them).

The service was really fast, the server keep serving the next food without giving you time to enjoy your meal.

Overall, it needs improvement, but still good.

Best sushi in Chicago hands down. I've had the Omakase multiple times and each time was absolutely amazing. The pearls, orange crush, angry crab and the carpaccio course at the beginning were extremely memorable and delicious. There are some incredible flavor combinations. I always look forward to the sashimi course at the end as the cuts of fish are very fresh. 

Great atmosphere as well! If you are at the bar, you can watch the Vizconde brothers prepare and plate your meal and the booths are cozy and great for a date night or intimate meal. The service is outstanding as well. Every time I've been I have never had anything to complain about and often the wait staff goes above and beyond to make sure my experience is perfect. I highly recommend the matcha creme brulee for dessert! This place is worth the $$. Next time I go back I plan on trying the Premium Omakase.

The best.

We came here after my husband's coworker highly recommended it as the best sushi in Chicago. A casual Wednesday dinner we told ourselves. Hah.

We didn't know much and decided we should try it tonight. When my husband tried to make reservations, he said open table didn't have much. I figured I could call later and try and see what we could get. Maybe it's more walk-in?

First interaction with the restaurant was exceptional. I didn't catch her name but the young lady who spoke to me was polite, patient and so so so helpful. For some reason when a hostess is like this at a busy place, I'm happily surprised. But impressed. She informed me they were booked solid, but just in case someone cancelled she took down my name, number and time of choice. 30 minutes later she called me with a cancellation and offered me the spot. I took it. Then a torrential downpour hit and getting home from work was impossible, let alone to dinner. 50 minutes of driving later (river north to west loop to Kaizan) we rolled in a little wet and super hungry, 20 minutes late.

Regardless of our delay, the same young lady checked in on us via phone while we parked and gently let us know they had reservations after us. We promised we would be out and completely understood. She was kind and patient with us as we walked in, slightly soaked. We were seated at the bar, and boy am I happy we were. This is no ordinary sushi spot. You are across from the action. Creative plates, focus, genius. I watched as twin chefs Melvin and Carlos plated each dish, more enticing than the next. It took all my will power to not sneakily chop stick pieces off the plates. Or steal some of Chef M's white bottled sake (shhhhh).

We had an attentive, warm, nice server - Brian. So genuinely into the food. The service is top notch, unpretentious and wonderful. Chef Carlos even gave us this "polenta" dish that was taste bud heaven. I love the people who work here.

What did we eat? Edamame, shishito peppers, our first uni experience - nigiri style, white tuna (requested raw) pearls, hamachi nigiri (raw), beef skewer, sashimi trio of toro, salmon belly, an in season fish I can't recall but delicious, "polenta" gift fish (omg), angry crab, and a bottle of hot sake to compliment. I may have missed something but I could've eaten more! Yum.

I can't wait to go back. I'm doing the omakase and requesting bar seating. Raw fish perfection. There is a reason on a night like tonight (flooding, winds, darkness) this place was booked solid. It's beyond. Go spoil yourself.

Wow. Thank you.

Kai Zan is one of the better places in the Chicago area where you can eat fresh sashimi. This is my second time eating here and I enjoyed my experience thoroughly. The service here is very fast, probably because you only have a set amount of time to dine. For two people, I believe it is around ninety minutes to finish your meal before you have to leave.

I ordered omakase both times I came here and noticed that a few menu items had changed. I was excited to see that this time, the orange rush was incorporated into the omakase menu. This was one of my favorite dishes that I had ordered a la carte the first time, but it added a hefty $10 to my bill. Overall, I thought the omakase menu allowed you to get a nice taste of many different items, however, not all of the dishes wowed me. My favorites were the escolar pearls and orange rush. Some misses for me were the oyster/scallop shooters (I'm not a fan of shooters) and char siu (which was a bit too tough for me to enjoy). I also ordered the uni hand-roll (not on the omakase menu) which looked spectacular, but for $28 I felt that it was a bit underwhelming. The uni was very fresh, however, and was a nice touch.

Make sure you save room for dessert! I almost think that the house-made desserts are better than the fish...! The green tea ice cream had an extremely strong green tea flavor which I loved. It did not taste artificial at all like many other green tea ice creams. The chocolate lava cake was pretty good as well and was a nice contrast to the ice cream.

If you just order omakase, the bill ends up being a bit over $80 per person which is certainly not cheap. I think it is a reasonable price for what you get and it is less expensive than what you would pay for a tasting menu at some other restaurants. Omakase was good, but some of the dishes were misses for me simply because I was not a fan of the ingredients. If I came back in the future, I would definitely order a la carte so that I can get foods that are more suited for my taste.

Best sushi in Chicago! We've tried everywhere old and new and always come back to Kai Zan. 

Always make reservations ahead of time!

Can share one omakase (which is enough food for two people in my opinion to taste different dishes) 

Service is always great too!

This is my favorite "treat yoself" sushi places. The chefs do a beautiful job on presentation, creativity and taste with all their dishes.

We went with a group of four and did two premium and two regular omakase (tasting menu). They were both amazing! The premium is expensive but it's worth a try and/or to do it for a special occasion. I believe the regular omakase doesn't change too frequently (I remember some of the  dishes from doing it before) but the premium was such a fun experience. We got to try a lot of different new ingredients and combinations. I have provided pictures to give you an idea of how beautiful the food is.

The private seating is nice option to have when you go with a small group.

The service was great! The chefs came to greet us and were very personable.

The whole experience is one that I will not forget!

Another year goes by and it's already time for another birthday dinner. My bf pretty much tells me what type of cuisine he wants and I choose a restaurant I've been wanting to try. (Always a win for me!!) This place is a little small, but the decor is cool and casual. The hostess was nice and attentive. We were greeted as soon as we stepped in and my bf was wished a happy birthday. Luckily, we were seated at one of the booths, so we were able to stretch out and get comfortable. I am in love with uni, so I had to ask if they had it. I was surprised to hear that they did not have uni that day (it was a Thursday, btw). However, our server quickly remembered that there was a small amount of uni reserved only for the premium omakase. Well then, I guess I didn't really have a choice! I like to indulge, especially on special occasions, so I had to get the premium omakase. Service was a little bit rushed, in my opinion. Our dishes came out pretty quickly with barely any wait in between, which is fine. But, I do not appreciate my plate being cleared from the table when I'm still chewing and holding a piece of food in my chopstick! Jeesh.

Anyway, on to the premium omakase.. There were a total of 10 dishes and the last one was dessert. I understand the concept of omakase, but I wish I had a little take home menu to remember what in the world I was eating. You will just have to look at my pictures and their barebone captions. Sorry! This is not a traditional omakase with just sushi. They have a lot of interesting dishes that make up majority of the courses. The servers did a great job at explaining everything. All of our dishes had complex and thorough descriptions of the ingredients, which I love to hear about. The presentations were great and the dishes were full of contrasting flavors, colors and textures. The nigiri and sashimi quality were what I expected it to be. So delicate, soft and clean. The pickled wasabi relish was so spicy, but fun to use. By the end of our savory dishes, we were stuffed to the brim. It was definitely an enjoyable dinner. They even gave us an extra dessert with a candle for my bf's birthday. That was a nice touch! 

Overall, it was a good experience with great food. I will have to come back to try their regular omakase.

Kai Zan is definitely really good, but I don't think it totally lived up to our expectations.  Our waiter was super quirky.  He didn't seem like much of a people person, which makes being a server at a restaurant a weird fit.  Anyways, we opted for the Omakase and were surprised that the price was lower, but for more courses than most restaurants ($65). They totally can squeeze more outta customers for the quality but maybe because it's further out from the city it's lower priced.  

I want to say there were 10 courses.  All of the courses were great, unique and great flavor, but we were really really fished out by then end. And for me, that means there was a lot of fish because seafood is my favorite food (see all other reviews of mine... you'll get it). The last dish was a ton of sashimi (and it was fantastic), but by the time we got to dish 10 it was almost hard to eat all of it, which was a shame.  Every single dish was some sort of raw seafood, which is totally expected for a sushi restaurant.  However, many Omakase dinners we've gotten in the city have some variation (king crab soup, seafood "dumpling", ramen), which I think we like a little bit more. I think they could benefit from doing less courses and just giving you bigger portions as well.  

Overall the quality of the fish was stellar and everything tasted great, but just be prepared for a lot lot lot of raw fish.  You will have a great meal here though.

Excellent omakase. A lot of variety and creation, a lot of food as well (almost too much) for 65$ which is actually cheap considering the quality of the food and of the service. We also tried a creme brulee and it was delicious. Just be advised that most of the plates are spicy. Definitely would go back if I come back to Chicago :)

Let me start by saying I've been to japan twice, and have friends of japan that cook here in America. So I have a small amount of things to compare this place to.

Though a small restaurant for American size, the decor is very nice. It had a Japanese feel, while still having an American feel since the staff is diverse. Music isn't loud, as a matter of fact, I don't know if I actually heard any music at all which is good.

This place is amazing. Maybe because we ordered the chefs choice omakase may have something to do it with. Everything was so fresh, and the flavors blended and melded together perfectly. I could taste the layers of rich fat and beef in the wagyu, as well and the hint of wasabi that wasabi microgreens added to the wagyu nigiri we had as one of our sushi nigiri sets. The dashi was also had was flavorful, with just enough salt and the tiny tobiko that popped in my mouth was both fun and good. Lobster mashed potatoes... heaven.

I loved every dish my husband and I had. I'm not a mackerel eater but the horse-striped mackerel was sweet, tender, and clean tasting. 

Expensive yes. Worth it, YES. We plan on coming back again and again.

Finally tried the Omakase, which was out of this world delicious and super filling.  Hubby was able to snag an early Friday night dinner reservation last minute.  I was a little worried about bringing baby girl, but everyone was so accommodating.  The space is cozy and there's no room for a high chair, but they seated us in the corner front booth next to the front window, which was enough space for her to sit and also roam around a bit in a controlled space.  Many of the staff came by to say hi to her and say how adorable she is (thanks guys!!).

It's difficult to pick a favorite from the Omakase, but also because I was so full halfway through and uncomfortably full by the last two dishes.  I like how it highlighted the offerings of the current menu so we could sample a little bit of everything.  I remember the Escolar Maguro Pearls and Angry Crab from our last visit, so it's good they kept the fan favorites.  Each dish was beautifully presented.  All the ingredients were fresh and of the highest quality.  The timing between dishes was a little rushed a few times, but our server apologized and gave us more time to enjoy each entree and slow down the pace a bit.  I'm glad I tried the shooters, but it was probably my least favorite given the texture.  I was pleasantly surprised with how much I liked the scallops in Orange Rush.  The dishes got heavier as dinner progressed, but I'm glad it ended with the fresh selection of sashimi.  Although I was stuffed beyond comprehension, I really wanted to try a dessert and so happy we ordered the Green Tea Creme Brulee.  It was so good we polished it off completely.

I'll have to prepare for the next time by starving myself the entire day so I can really make room for all the Omakase components!

I went after finals with friends and was excited for the regular omakase (10 courses) which was highly recommended online as the best price in Chicago. $65/person and we paid $5 for extra Uni in our shooters - best decision! The shooters were our favorite. Each dish was an exploding bite of flavor. One of my friends didn't like mushrooms, but that just meant more for me. After going through most of the courses we were still a bit hungry, but then they brought the sashimi platter that definitely filled us up.

The server was very knowledgeable and friendly. The courses were brought one by one with a good pace, so you don't have to think about the 90min limit.

The only downfall is parking is kind of hard to find - have to go into the alleys.

I'm already making plans to go back for my birthday to try the premium omakase.

Good tasting. Not exceptionally creative or unique. Nothing was overly impressive, except for the booth area. Very well done booth area. The food seemed a bit too ordinary yet is trying to present itself otherwise. Overpriced, as most sushi restaurants are. Tasty. Not bad. Not great. Trendy. For the interested. Small portions for price. Acting like they serve you a fine dining or very rare to find fish yet is on the basic spectrum of fish types. Good tuna but maybe in Japan it's a joke. Fresh "tasting", good flavors but not buying into it... Probably won't return.

We used to love Kai Zan (and recommended them to everyone!), but unfortunately a poor service experience will prevent me from coming back or ever recommending this place again. I'm quite disappointed since service was previously one of the most amazing parts of the experience.

I made a reservation for family coming into town saying "You have to try this place - best sushi / fusion since I was in Japan!" They were running late (just flew in), and were told that they couldn't order the omakase if late by more than 15 mins. FYI, each reservation slot is for 90 minutes, and in my previous 4 times dining there, I always finished within 55 minutes, well ahead of the reserved timeslot. 

I got a call at 5:48pm (screenshot to prove it!) to confirm a reservation for the next day (yes I made another reservation), and the lady noticed that I had one for today and that they were running late (res at 5:30pm). During this phonecall, my family showed up at the restaurant. Even though they were only 3 minutes past the 15 min deadline (5:48 vs. 5;45), she wouldn't let them order the omakase.

This whole experience along with the attitude of the lady on the phone has left a real poor mark on Kai Zan. She was very passive aggressive and kept replying "I appreciate it" when I pleaded to allow my family who flew in from out of town to order the omakase. Appreciate what?!

Yes, we were late by 3 minutes, so our fault. However, the way the restaurant and the lady on phone handled the situation is not customer friendly. I don't understand why a mere 3 minutes makes an actual difference, especially when based on my prior experiences its more than enough time.

Feel free to msg me for more details.

I don't know where to start. The best sushi I've had to this day. I was at a Michelin star sushi restaurant couple months before, but Kai Zan truly blew me away.

Our server, Arlene, was phenomenal. Wonderful personality, knowledgeable and make great recommendations. We sat at the bar so that my husband could go with the omakase option. My husband cannot stop talking about the following: oxtail soup, wagyu beef wrapped scallop, quail egg/scallop shooter and the quality/grade of the sushi in general. He said it was the best uni and mackeral he's ever had. They also had a wonderful selection of craft beers from Japan.

We had THREE dessert dishes if you can believe it. Pumpkin ice cream crumble, Mochi ice cream and the refreshing green tea matcha ice cream.

Please be sure to make a reservation and be on time so you have the full 90 minutes to enjoy your meal.

Thank you for such a great experience and meal. We can't wait to return!!!

omakase.  real japanese food.  probably the best i've had since leaving tokyo.  i don't know of another place that does this.  if they do, i would be surprised if it comes close to this.

i LOVE this way of eating.  you trust the artist.  the chef.  because they know more than you.  it's awesome not to have to make any decisions.  i would eat this way every day if i could.

i went for my birthday.  it's in a great hood where it's easy to park & there are lots of nooks & crannies-black dog for dessert, squasht, an awesome hand made boutique that is a perfect place to buy myself a sweet hat for my special day & plenty of ukrainian groceries.

they have 2 kinds of spreads to choose from-chef's choice ($65) & special chef's choice ($115).  you can add uni on everything for $5.  they are big on uni.  i saw a few towers of it going out.

i'm not going to describe in detail all of the items because there's a pic of the menu below & it's pretty detailed but i assure you that i licked each & every platter clean.  that's all you need to know.

the perfect fresh tender fish is a beauty to behold.  the atmosphere is very similar to tokyo omakase restos-small, intimate, clean, calm, beautiful.  the service is unprecedented.  probably the best service i have ever had in chicago.

make a reservation.  i went at 4:30 & it was already full.

do it.  do it now.

The food here has always been good. I've been here three times now. The prices are reasonable for the quality. It's by no means cheap to eat here, but it's definitely worth it for the quality you get. The servers are always friendly too. So, why just three stars? Well, it's because of the time restriction. We had an early reservation at 5:15 pm on a Thursday. We had exactly 90 minutes to finish our meal. From the start of the reservation, the clock starts ticking. We took a little while to decide what to order, but our food came super fast once we ordered. Since we were seated at the bar, we had to eat super fast to make room for the next dish. We felt super rushed. I really like their food, but the time restraint really dampens the experience. When we left it was 6:48 pm, and the sun was still out. I understand that it's a small place, but if your business is doing so well, then maybe it's time to expand. It's better than losing your customers.

Although I was stuffed beyond comprehension, I really wanted to try a dessert and so happy we ordered the Green Tea Creme Brulee.  It was so good we polished it off completely.

I'll have to prepare for the next time by starving myself the entire day so I can really make room for all the Omakase components!

I went after finals with friends and was excited for the regular omakase (10 courses) which was highly recommended online as the best price in Chicago. $65/person and we paid $5 for extra Uni in our shooters - best decision! The shooters were our favorite. Each dish was an exploding bite of flavor. One of my friends didn't like mushrooms, but that just meant more for me. After going through most of the courses we were still a bit hungry, but then they brought the sashimi platter that definitely filled us up.

The server was very knowledgeable and friendly. The courses were brought one by one with a good pace, so you don't have to think about the 90min limit.

The only downfall is parking is kind of hard to find - have to go into the alleys.

I'm already making plans to go back for my birthday to try the premium omakase.

Good tasting. Not exceptionally creative or unique. Nothing was overly impressive, except for the booth area. Very well done booth area. The food seemed a bit too ordinary yet is trying to present itself otherwise. Overpriced, as most sushi restaurants are. Tasty. Not bad. Not great. Trendy. For the interested. Small portions for price. Acting like they serve you a fine dining or very rare to find fish yet is on the basic spectrum of fish types. Good tuna but maybe in Japan it's a joke. Fresh "tasting", good flavors but not buying into it... Probably won't return.

We used to love Kai Zan (and recommended them to everyone!), but unfortunately a poor service experience will prevent me from coming back or ever recommending this place again. I'm quite disappointed since service was previously one of the most amazing parts of the experience.

I made a reservation for family coming into town saying "You have to try this place - best sushi / fusion since I was in Japan!" They were running late (just flew in), and were told that they couldn't order the omakase if late by more than 15 mins. FYI, each reservation slot is for 90 minutes, and in my previous 4 times dining there, I always finished within 55 minutes, well ahead of the reserved timeslot. 

I got a call at 5:48pm (screenshot to prove it!) to confirm a reservation for the next day (yes I made another reservation), and the lady noticed that I had one for today and that they were running late (res at 5:30pm). During this phonecall, my family showed up at the restaurant. Even though they were only 3 minutes past the 15 min deadline (5:48 vs. 5;45), she wouldn't let them order the omakase.

This whole experience along with the attitude of the lady on the phone has left a real poor mark on Kai Zan. She was very passive aggressive and kept replying "I appreciate it" when I pleaded to allow my family who flew in from out of town to order the omakase. Appreciate what?!

Yes, we were late by 3 minutes, so our fault. However, the way the restaurant and the lady on phone handled the situation is not customer friendly. I don't understand why a mere 3 minutes makes an actual difference, especially when based on my prior experiences its more than enough time.

Feel free to msg me for more details.

I don't know where to start. The best sushi I've had to this day. I was at a Michelin star sushi restaurant couple months before, but Kai Zan truly blew me away.

Our server, Arlene, was phenomenal. Wonderful personality, knowledgeable and make great recommendations. We sat at the bar so that my husband could go with the omakase option. My husband cannot stop talking about the following: oxtail soup, wagyu beef wrapped scallop, quail egg/scallop shooter and the quality/grade of the sushi in general. He said it was the best uni and mackeral he's ever had. They also had a wonderful selection of craft beers from Japan.

We had THREE dessert dishes if you can believe it. Pumpkin ice cream crumble, Mochi ice cream and the refreshing green tea matcha ice cream.

Please be sure to make a reservation and be on time so you have the full 90 minutes to enjoy your meal.

Thank you for such a great experience and meal. We can't wait to return!!!

omakase.  real japanese food.  probably the best i've had since leaving tokyo.  i don't know of another place that does this.  if they do, i would be surprised if it comes close to this.

i LOVE this way of eating.  you trust the artist.  the chef.  because they know more than you.  it's awesome not to have to make any decisions.  i would eat this way every day if i could.

i went for my birthday.  it's in a great hood where it's easy to park & there are lots of nooks & crannies-black dog for dessert, squasht, an awesome hand made boutique that is a perfect place to buy myself a sweet hat for my special day & plenty of ukrainian groceries.

they have 2 kinds of spreads to choose from-chef's choice ($65) & special chef's choice ($115).  you can add uni on everything for $5.  they are big on uni.  i saw a few towers of it going out.

i'm not going to describe in detail all of the items because there's a pic of the menu below & it's pretty detailed but i assure you that i licked each & every platter clean.  that's all you need to know.

the perfect fresh tender fish is a beauty to behold.  the atmosphere is very similar to tokyo omakase restos-small, intimate, clean, calm, beautiful.  the service is unprecedented.  probably the best service i have ever had in chicago.

make a reservation.  i went at 4:30 & it was already full.

do it.  do it now.

The food here has always been good. I've been here three times now. The prices are reasonable for the quality. It's by no means cheap to eat here, but it's definitely worth it for the quality you get. The servers are always friendly too. So, why just three stars? Well, it's because of the time restriction. We had an early reservation at 5:15 pm on a Thursday. We had exactly 90 minutes to finish our meal. From the start of the reservation, the clock starts ticking. We took a little while to decide what to order, but our food came super fast once we ordered. Since we were seated at the bar, we had to eat super fast to make room for the next dish. We felt super rushed. I really like their food, but the time restraint really dampens the experience. When we left it was 6:48 pm, and the sun was still out. I understand that it's a small place, but if your business is doing so well, then maybe it's time to expand. It's better than losing your customers.

Hidden gem on the west side of Chicago. We couldn't decide what to order so we opted for one chef's choice and one premium omakase in order to experience their current offerings. Overall we had a lovely evening. The dishes were thoughtfully prepared. They were visually beautiful and tasteful. Or as I like to say they had dining hat trick- TTV - taste, texture and visual. 

In addition to the food, the service was exceptional. We had a trio of waiters present our 19 dishes (omg) and the culinary knowledge shared between them was outstanding. 

Can't wait to go back.

After we heard that Kai Zan was on the top of multiple people's lists, my wife and I decided to give it a try.  Not sure of which tasting menu to choose, we went with the premium omakase meal.  

We really did not enjoy it.  There was so much richness to the meal that we were overloaded halfway through.  Everything was toro this or kobe beef fat that.  By the time we got to the sushi and sashimi courses (which were amazing), we were so overwhelmed by the earlier courses that it was hard to enjoy.  This might just be personal taste, but we were not fans.  

But the sushi and sashimi courses were good enough that I was curious about the other tasting menu.  So a few months later, we ventured back and the cheaper omakase menu was INCREDIBLE.  We enjoyed every course and we would recommend this place to anyone.

I had the pleasure to return to the exquisite Kai Zan. Last time I got the $100 Chefs Omakase and it was the best meal I've ever experienced. This time we opted for the $60 since we had a bigger group. I haven't sat in the booths before now and I really enjoyed it, cozy and cute. Would definitely recommend being in the other dining room so you can see the chef at work, bar preferably. We had to make a reservation a week or so ahead of time. The wait staff is always great and did great considering all of the plate changes for 5 people getting the omakase. 

If you aren't sure if the extra $40 is worth it, trust me I was there too. Honestly, this is the most expensive meal I've had but this splurge smacks your taste buds in the face! I'm not a fan of Uni and the kitchen was also so nice by offering me a different choice or more of something else when Uni was called for. Our waitress recommended the 2012 Weissburgunder white wine, it had hints of butter and that isn't a bad thing! Our group enjoyed two bottles. We will definitely be back this year, I hope, to get the $100 meal again!

We tried the dessert a couple times and just haven't liked them too much, I had the chocolate sesame one and won't get it again. The $100 comes with a dessert but you probably won't have room anyway for dessert after the $60 Omakase either. 

Recommendations:
- This meal can be very filling so eat a smaller lunch if possible, a couple ladies in our group were getting pretty full about 70% into the meal.
- Get seating in the main dining room, makes a huge difference being right there!
- Reservations ahead of time.
- Just go with it! I didn't know half of the things I was eating but I sure remember them every time I think of this place. 
- Even if you aren't a sushi person, honestly I am not a huge one either, this place isn't just sashimi and rolls. They put so much into each of these dishes and has kind of ruined me for the rest of my life LOL....

If quality is your number one priority, then I highly recommend Kai Zan. 

I was a bit thrown off at the atmosphere of the restaurant. I imagined a very quiet place with some classical music playing in the background (stereotypical view of high-end restaurants?). However, it was lively and vibrant, which was great.

I had the omakase, the two specials, which were wagyu beef nigiri and toro, mochi, and the matcha creme brulee. First, the presentation on all of these were amazing. I'm not one to take photos of food, but I just had to because it was so beautiful. For the omakase, you can tell that each item on the list was placed purposefully, in terms of "what does the chef want you to taste next?" 

It's hard to pick a favorite because everything tasted incredible, but I would say that the shooter was definitely something unique and highly worth trying. I would also highly recommend the matcha creme brulee.

But, I think what made the experience great for me was the waiter. The way he presented and communicated each dish to us was pure poetry, and the way he interacted with us was probably the best service I will receive in a while. 

Overall, highly recommend going. I am hoping to come again to try the premium omakase.

One of the best sushi restaurants I've been to in AWHILE. Came here for a special date night, and it was an experience! The attention to detail at Kai Zan is phenomenal to say the least.

YAY: 
- Angry crab (2pc) and orange crush (2pc) is a must. Interesting flavors and it melts in your mouth.
- ****Wagyu beef with quail egg (2pc) Perfectly seered edges. Melts in your mouth.
- Fatty tuna (2pc), probably the best tuna of my life.
- Escolar pearls (white tuna)
- Excellent service. Our server Justin talked through the menu and described all of our orders with ease. 
- Interior is warm but modern, inviting, and relaxing. You'd never expect the inside to look as nice from just looking on the outside
- Food presentation was continually satisfying and beautiful!
- If you love mussels, get the dynamite mussels. Everything about it was perfect. 

NAY:
- not sure what it was called, but 'smoked salmon in a pot with fog.' It smelled amazing and had dried ice to look cool, but it was actually cold cooked fish with a sour/vinagar-y flavor. Not my cup of tea.

EXTRA: 
- make reservations: the best seat is the window seat!
- best for groups of 2 because of food distribution and limited seating
- ask the server for personal favorites that aren't on the menu.

Chicago's best sushi. Deserving of a Michelin star. Hype worthy. 

To start, the ambience is sleekly romantic. The cavernous booths for larger groups next to the bar near the entrance seem to offer a phenomenal experience. The smaller booths in the kitchen room are also authentic and tasteful. We had the pleasure of sitting directly in front of the twin (yup!) chefs and watch them hone their craft. These guys work like a manufacturing line; precise and efficient! 

We weren't starving, so opted for a la carte instead of omekase; wise choice! 

Uni shooters: awesome blast of flavor, the urchin is decadent, sauces add some saltiness, quail egg balances the texture. 

Escolar/Maduro pearls: decadent, delicious, freshest fish I've had in Chicago. 

Angry crab: tiny portion, but delicious. While other sushi joints overpower mediocre fish with spice, this dish featured a subtle hit of spice which complemented the tuna perfectly!

Hamachi carpaccio: My favorite dish! Slight tweaking of flavors with a bit of oil, tobiko, and greens, but this is the way a fresh offshoot of sashimi is supposed to shine! 

Fiesta maki: the freshness of the fish made this awesome. Looks like any other generic sushi roll, but the texture and flavor of the fish propel it above the competition. 

Can't wait to come back with a bigger appetite and try the omekase! Love that this is in my general vicinity.

The food was fantastic as usual. Very composed, great flavor combinations. We had a bottle of rose sparkling wine and most of the sushi bites on the menu. The polenta bite with kale and tuna was delicious and the uni was very fresh. All in all the good was great.

The service was good until the waitress dropped off the check and came back 2 minutes later to rush us out. It felt like we stopped spending money so her attitude changed and she was like get the f out. We had a 715 res and the next one after us was for 915. This happened at 840. She actually said, "if you could finish up your conversation else where there are other tables waiting." We had been talking for 2 minutes after she dropped the check off. It honestly ruined a great meal. So disappointing. We know the place has a reputation for rude service and we commented on how they must have changed, then that happened. Too bad.

GO HERE. Don't order rolls and such - get the omakase and they'll serve you a perfect meal. My husband and I got one omakase and one premium omakase and then shared a bottle of wine. It was a lot of food but we wanted to try everything! And we finished it all (FAT). It's a very small space so make sure you make a reservation if you want a guaranteed seat and they also will potentially run out of the omakases towards of the end of the night. Obviously pricey but absolutely worth it - perfect for special occasions. It'll be like no other meal you've had.

Such a unique experience. Definitely recommend doing the omakase. It's $60 and we added uni for $5 more (worth it). 
Make sure you make a reservation. I did feel like some of the courses came out too fast, would've liked a slower pace but overall deliciousness makes it worth it. $15 corkage fee is a nice too. 
We ordered a separate dessert. It was the charred squash or deconstructed pumpkin pie as they called it. It was the only thing that night that didn't knock our socks off. Would probably opt for dessert elsewhere after trying it. 
Overall some of the highest quality sushi available in Chicago and a fun dining experience if you're looking for a pri fixe dining option.

We did the chefs omakase. And it lived up to my expectations fully.  What a fun tasting adventure.  Each bite was unique and flavorful and full of fresh fish.  Creative pairings of sauces and seafood and presentations.  My mouth said wow all dinner.  The finale was a plate a sashimi and all thr cuts were thick and yummy and Melt in your mouthy.  Thr only thing that made me happier was the value.  At $65 this is a great deal to have this experience.

Kai Zan will forever change the way you view Sushi. This restaurant exceeds expectations in every way possible, from the time you're greeted by the host until you leave, everything is A+++.

The staff is nothing short of amazing. While you are in the presence of the two most amazing Sushi Chef's (Melvin and Carlo) on earth, you also have the opportunity to meet a extremely friendly and personable line up of hosts and wait staff. Every single one of them ensures that your experience is unforgettable. I've been coming here regularly for about 2 years now (at least once a week) and truly feel as if I am part of the Kai Zan family, its unlike any connection I have ever had with any other restaurant.

Now let's get to the good stuff...aka what you MUST order. Just to start off, I've virtually tried just about every single dish on the menu and can confidently say, its all amazing. Not only is every dish unique, well thought through and different from   other "common" sushi spots, but the QUALITY of the ingredients used is a huge difference maker. Melvin and Carlo will only serve you the highest quality of fish/seafood and if they are unable to source ingredients that meet their expectations, well then it won't be on the menu (specifically Uni).

Personal favorites and must try list:

Escolar Pearls-I wish they offered a "bottomless" special of this dish, the first time I tried these I ordered them 3 times...stop judging me.

Maguro Pearls-A close 2nd to the Escolar Pearls, absolutely incredible.

Dynamite Mussels-Personally, I had a strong dislike of the texture of mussels my entire life, until the Chef's recommended I try them....they're unlike any mussels you'll ever have and an absolute must order-the flavor is mind blowing!

Angry Crab-I recommend getting these as hand rolls (not on the menu), it is hands down the best hand roll you will ever eat in your entire life, don't take my word for it, try it and I guarantee you will order at least 2 during your meal.

Uni Toro Tartare Special-If they have Uni, they will most likely offer this special. I recommend you order this because its unlike any dish you will ever eat anywhere else. You receive a beautifully presented dish with Uni, Toro, Pickled Wasabi and a Qual Egg on top (there's more in there...trust me) which you mix up and then create your own rolls of goodness with....this one is arguably my favorite dish all together, ever!

Green Monster-This roll is presented beautifully, its a avocado wrapped roll that is second to none and extremely delicious!

Polenta Bites-Another creation that is over the top. Its simple, but the flavor is HUGE!

King Oyster Mushroom-Unlike any mushroom dish you will ever taste in your life. The consistency and flavor if this make it hard to believe you're eating a mushroom skewer!

All of their shooters are amazing but the Uni Shooter is my favorite. The concept is actually not something I generally would "enjoy" but after having tried all of them I can now understand why they are so popular!

I recommend always getting any and all specials they have, these are always the absolute BEST and AMAZING creations. You will never want to miss out on these. If you show your face often enough, you may even get lucky from time to time and have them re-created....only if you're lucky though!

I recommend you sit at the Sushi Bar if you have the ability to, watching the Chef's in action adds to the experience. They are all very friendly, outgoing and are fun to watch as they create greatness!

Thank you Kai Zan for coming into my life, I will forever be indebted to you for changing the way I look at not only Sushi, but dining experiences all together! It goes without saying, I am your biggest fan and look forward to many more evenings spent in your beautiful restaurant in the first two seats at the Sushi Bar (as always!).

It was hard to make a reservation. We made a reservation after 9:40pm at Sat. Had premium Omakase and regular Omakase. Both were really great! But the price of premium is double of regular one. I think it was not worth it that price. But overall it was really good experience at Chicago.

The food was fantastic as usual. Very composed, great flavor combinations. We had a bottle of rose sparkling wine and most of the sushi bites on the menu. The polenta bite with kale and tuna was delicious and the uni was very fresh. All in all the good was great.

The service was good until the waitress dropped off the check and came back 2 minutes later to rush us out. It felt like we stopped spending money so her attitude changed and she was like get the f out. We had a 715 res and the next one after us was for 915. This happened at 840. She actually said, "if you could finish up your conversation else where there are other tables waiting." We had been talking for 2 minutes after she dropped the check off. It honestly ruined a great meal. So disappointing. We know the place has a reputation for rude service and we commented on how they must have changed, then that happened. Too bad.

Food was excellent as usual however they make you eat in 90 minutes , and believe me they keep reminding you every 20 minutes how much time is left.  Extremely rude and very very rushed.  They rushed us for our order and never let us finish each course before the next would come out.  Terrible dining experience.  Cheapens the experience.

Best sushi I've ever had and I refuse to eat anywhere else for sushi.  I wish I could keep this my little secret since this place is pretty popular.  Reservations must be in advance.  Don't be afraid to experiment and always order the specials.  I can't wait to go back!

GO HERE. Don't order rolls and such - get the omakase and they'll serve you a perfect meal. My husband and I got one omakase and one premium omakase and then shared a bottle of wine. It was a lot of food but we wanted to try everything! And we finished it all (FAT). It's a very small space so make sure you make a reservation if you want a guaranteed seat and they also will potentially run out of the omakases towards of the end of the night. Obviously pricey but absolutely worth it - perfect for special occasions. It'll be like no other meal you've had.

Such a unique experience. Definitely recommend doing the omakase. It's $60 and we added uni for $5 more (worth it). 
Make sure you make a reservation. I did feel like some of the courses came out too fast, would've liked a slower pace but overall deliciousness makes it worth it. $15 corkage fee is a nice too. 
We ordered a separate dessert. It was the charred squash or deconstructed pumpkin pie as they called it. It was the only thing that night that didn't knock our socks off. Would probably opt for dessert elsewhere after trying it. 
Overall some of the highest quality sushi available in Chicago and a fun dining experience if you're looking for a pri fixe dining option.

We did the chefs omakase. And it lived up to my expectations fully.  What a fun tasting adventure.  Each bite was unique and flavorful and full of fresh fish.  Creative pairings of sauces and seafood and presentations.  My mouth said wow all dinner.  The finale was a plate a sashimi and all thr cuts were thick and yummy and Melt in your mouthy.  Thr only thing that made me happier was the value.  At $65 this is a great deal to have this experience.

Kai Zan will forever change the way you view Sushi. This restaurant exceeds expectations in every way possible, from the time you're greeted by the host until you leave, everything is A+++.

The staff is nothing short of amazing. While you are in the presence of the two most amazing Sushi Chef's (Melvin and Carlo) on earth, you also have the opportunity to meet a extremely friendly and personable line up of hosts and wait staff. Every single one of them ensures that your experience is unforgettable. I've been coming here regularly for about 2 years now (at least once a week) and truly feel as if I am part of the Kai Zan family, its unlike any connection I have ever had with any other restaurant.

Now let's get to the good stuff...aka what you MUST order. Just to start off, I've virtually tried just about every single dish on the menu and can confidently say, its all amazing. Not only is every dish unique, well thought through and different from   other "common" sushi spots, but the QUALITY of the ingredients used is a huge difference maker. Melvin and Carlo will only serve you the highest quality of fish/seafood and if they are unable to source ingredients that meet their expectations, well then it won't be on the menu (specifically Uni).

Personal favorites and must try list:

Escolar Pearls-I wish they offered a "bottomless" special of this dish, the first time I tried these I ordered them 3 times...stop judging me.

Maguro Pearls-A close 2nd to the Escolar Pearls, absolutely incredible.

Dynamite Mussels-Personally, I had a strong dislike of the texture of mussels my entire life, until the Chef's recommended I try them....they're unlike any mussels you'll ever have and an absolute must order-the flavor is mind blowing!

I thought that another restaurant was my fave sushi spot in town...it's now a clear second! Everything about my experience at Kai Zan was great - the service, the decor and private booths, the sale recommendation, and of course the food itself. Every bite was delicious in a different way. Can't wait to try the omakase next time!

Recommended: wagyu special, that one with the basil oil, the polenta bites, and then pretty much everything else, on and off the menu.

Amazing sushi!  Hands down get the OMAKASE!  It has samples of their most popular sushi.  You can't go wrong with the OMAKASE.  

My favs on the OMAKASE menu:
1). My mouth fell in love with the ESCOLAR & MAGURO PEARLS.  Seriously the escolar was silky and buttery.  The pan seared tuna was perfect.  I couldn't stop smiling when I took the bite.  The pearls are so tiny, and they pop when you bite on them .  

2) Fiesta MAKI... Get this.  The salmon and tuna all work well with the cilantro, masago, chili oil... Oh gosh I seriously want two rolls to myself.  You definitely don't want to share this with anyone!  Not even with Grandma!!!

3). Orange Rush ... That citrus glaze is refreshing.  I didn't think it would work with sushi, but it does .  

4). Madai Caraccio... Light and refreshing.  A taste of Italy ... It reminds me of a Caprese Salad.  

For drinks I tried the pear sake.  It was good.

Sooo DO THE OMAKASE already!  You can't go wrong with it!

I enjoyed my meal very much. Extremely well organized staff  polite and efficient.   The non sushi entree was average. All of the sushi was fresh and I feel good the next day.   Interesting combinations.  Nice finish with full size meal type sushi at the end. 4.5 stars had the tasting price fixed   Good green tea.  Nice rapid fire service.   A little Tabasco was added at the right times. 

Interesting non commercialized neighboorhoood.

Kai Zan offers a unique take on sushi; the sushi is, by no means, traditional, but at the same time the flavors work quite well. 

The omakase is 15 courses and definitely enough for two people to share, especially if you double up on some of the items that come in one portion. My favorites were the madai carpaccio, escolar pearls, and the polenta bites (I think--this was on the house). While I'm usually not a huge fan of anything that deviates from traditional sushi, I appreciated the creativity that went into the rolls--the flavors were unique and well thought out. The kale in the polenta bites, for instance, was crispy, and the slightly bitter flavors worked surprisingly well with the toro. We also got an order of the madai collar, which was also quite good and well priced for the portion size.

The one thing I would stay away from would be the traditional sashimi; this may have been an off day, but the sashimi I had was not very fresh, especially the maguro, which was a very oxidized, dark color. Hence the fiesta maki I got that day was also not very good.  

Overall, this was more of a 3.5 rating because of the lack of fresh sashimi. The hits, though, were enough for me to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Great, fresh seafood! Definitely the best sushi I've ever had! 

We got the omakase for two people (add $20) and enjoyed it very much! The only complaint was that we got way too much food. 

We got to meet a chef as he was walking around after the sushi bar had closed and he was really nice and personable. Although we were not able to, definitely try to sit at the bar! 

The omakase is also really adaptable for certain tastes! The waiter saw that we didn't enjoy the shooters (not a big fan of raw eggs) so he gave us a complimentary replacement to make sure that we would enjoy all 10 courses to the omakase. 

Definitely must try restaurant with great service! 

Tip: make sure to reserve early to get a good time to eat. We didn't reserve early enough so we had a late, 9:30 dinner.

I decided to go for solo dining on my birthday and went to Kai Zan and tried their famous Omakase.
 IT WAS FANTASTIC!
Every course they served was a piece of art. A couple of them that tickled all my senses were the shooters (I can still taste and feel this one. Just amazing!)  and the scallop wrapped with salmon (heaven in my mouth) I wish I know all of their names, but it's best to leave the excitement for first timers. Their fish is fresh and very, very good. Definitely a must try!

I sat at the bar, good choice to watch the chefs work their magic. Service was perfect, very comfortable. The place has a nice, quiet ambiance with the right amount of noise.

For the price of their very delicious Omakase, it's THE best deal. The place is not as fancy but they obviously put all their pride and excellence in their magnificent dishes.

Very cool place. 

Simply, the best sushi I've ever had, and I love love love sushi. The omakase at around $70 is totally worth it. I was worried that it wasn't going to be filling enough and it ended up being plenty of food. 

The large booths were nice and very private. Makes you feel like a VIP. 

A couple of the highlights for me were the angry crab, the sashimi, and the shooters. All delicious. 

Make sure you check this place out.

Came here on a Friday night - best sushi I have ever had anywhere hands down. They don't even have soy sauce sitting on the table as this is already incorporated into the roll. Each bite was packed full of flavor but wasn't like your typical sushi where it is covered in too much sauce and cream cheese. They rely on actual good quality fish. Tuna Magura might have been my favorite. Try a couple of rolls as these are not huge rolls. They focus on quality taste each bite. Will be back.

I'm not a sushi lover and before Kai Zan, I could have gone the rest of my life and never eaten sushi again and I would have been A-okay with it. I will say now that I am a sushi lover and Kai Zan is drool worthy. Have I had sushi before? Plenty of times. I'm half Japanese, I've had it my whole life and it was always just whatever, it was good but I never cared if I had it and I certainly never craved it. Kai Zan makes me CRAVE sushi and their fish is out of this world, melt in your mouth delicious.....will I be back? Duh. I'm pretty sure I've tried almost everything on the menu and what I can say is that it's flavorful and you don't need soy or hot sauce. Everything is executed to perfection and the flavors are explosively delicious. Holy crap, I need a napkin to wipe the drool from the corner of my mouth just thinking about my several experiences there. Go, go, go to Kai Zan. 

Favorites?
Angry crab, orange rush, escolar pearls, otoro, seguro, their specials are always on point, anything with scallops....the grill seared tuna....I mean, you could literally pick menu items blindly and not be disappointed with anything (Except uni. I hate uni) but if you love it, I'm sure theirs is the best you can get. If they can make me love everything else except uni, holy crap, job well done. This is the only place I will ever eat sushi from again as nothing else is comparable or even close. 

Bravo Kai Zan. Bravo.

A couple of the highlights for me were the angry crab, the sashimi, and the shooters. All delicious. 

Make sure you check this place out.

Came here on a Friday night - best sushi I have ever had anywhere hands down. They don't even have soy sauce sitting on the table as this is already incorporated into the roll. Each bite was packed full of flavor but wasn't like your typical sushi where it is covered in too much sauce and cream cheese. They rely on actual good quality fish. Tuna Magura might have been my favorite. Try a couple of rolls as these are not huge rolls. They focus on quality taste each bite. Will be back.

I'm not a sushi lover and before Kai Zan, I could have gone the rest of my life and never eaten sushi again and I would have been A-okay with it. I will say now that I am a sushi lover and Kai Zan is drool worthy. Have I had sushi before? Plenty of times. I'm half Japanese, I've had it my whole life and it was always just whatever, it was good but I never cared if I had it and I certainly never craved it. Kai Zan makes me CRAVE sushi and their fish is out of this world, melt in your mouth delicious.....will I be back? Duh. I'm pretty sure I've tried almost everything on the menu and what I can say is that it's flavorful and you don't need soy or hot sauce. Everything is executed to perfection and the flavors are explosively delicious. Holy crap, I need a napkin to wipe the drool from the corner of my mouth just thinking about my several experiences there. Go, go, go to Kai Zan. 

Favorites?
Angry crab, orange rush, escolar pearls, otoro, seguro, their specials are always on point, anything with scallops....the grill seared tuna....I mean, you could literally pick menu items blindly and not be disappointed with anything (Except uni. I hate uni) but if you love it, I'm sure theirs is the best you can get. If they can make me love everything else except uni, holy crap, job well done. This is the only place I will ever eat sushi from again as nothing else is comparable or even close. 

Bravo Kai Zan. Bravo.

I was not sure what to order, so I decided to have the chef's choice. Every single dish was beautifully presented and the flavours were awesome. The area is small and cozy, and staffs are kind and attentive.

If you are a true sushi lover, and know your fish and flavor combination, do yourself a favor and save your money and spend it somewhere else. I'm still pondering how this place has 4.5 stars. Honestly, I don't even know where to begin of what went wrong w/ this meal. My friend and I had a reservation, and it was fairly difficult securing a reservation, but upon arrival, there were quite a number of open tables. We both ordered the premium omakase, and by no means was cheap, even being a life long New Yorker. If I am paying $115 for sushi, it better be some damn good sushi...

First dish - tuna tartar with bunch of edible flowers and taro chips. Not impressed off the bat.
Second dish - potato soup with anchovies. This would've been a decent dish if the soup wasn't cold. Timing was very off all night -- most of my hot dishes were cold.
Third dish (chef's amuse bouche) - one piece of spicy toro...yes you heard that right - toro mixed in with spicy mayo. Should be a crime. Should never use those two words in a sentence. For all I know, it could've been salmon, or blue fin tuna - why would you mix mayo (a fatty content) with toro (a fatty fish)? Also, on top, another edible flower and a crispy kale. At this point of the meal, I'm so confused.
Fourth dish - Daikon wrapped in a piece of yellow tail atop of some smashed avocado, and yes garnished with ANOTHER EDIBLE FLOWER. This is probably one of the worst dishes of all. The mushy fish with the mushy avocado that is mixed with some sweet sauce and the bland flavorless daikon - very nauseating bite.
Fifth fish - cup that is layered with truffles, with truffle mousse on the bottom, as well as seared scallops, atop with wasabi tobiko, lemon zest, and wasabi tobiko, (and yes, some more edible flowers). They really threw the kitchen sink on this one. The most bougie looking thing I've seen. This photo instagrams and snaps well, but just a lot going on with this one. The scallops taste great on its own, but when mixing with the mousse, might be just a tad too much....and the wasabi tobiko...just a mistake. The wasbi-ness of the tobiko overpowers the entire dish. Almost seems as of they just wanted some greenness on the plate.
Sixth dish - Beef. This dish was actually decent, but it was cold when given to us.
Seventh dish - Nigiri. Toro and amberjack were fine. Lobster was garnished ontop with something that tasted like big mac sauce atop with some black tobiko and an edible flower. Not a fan what so ever. Beef sushi was fine except it was garnished with black tobiko and some other sauce...and an edible flower. If they were just focused on just created a clean bite with these fishes, it would be success, but for now these sushi were sub-par.
Eighth dish - salmon belly crusted with herbs. The salmon belly taste good - but all the extra garnishes threw and turned me off. Why is there a stick of scallion? Why put a lemon on the bottom of the salmon piece? Do you want us to use it? A lot of the garnishes didn't make any sense to me. Also these flowers need to go.
Ninth dish - crab with basil, tobiko, gooseberries, and cucumber. This dish was described as a palette cleanser. Absolutely nothing palette cleansing about this dish except the optics of the cucumber.
Tenth dish - sashimi course. At this point i'm to full to eat anything. They did not provide any soy sauce or wasabi for this dish...how confusing. The toro for this plate had better toro for the sushi piece served earlier.
Dessert - grainy sorbet with coconut jelly. Not a fan.

In summary, you are paying premium omakase to have the chefs put some edible flowers on every single one of your plate and concocting random expensive ingredients together hoping to wow their guests. Maybe the $65 omakase would be more valuable, but nonetheless I'm still very, very disappointed....

Great food and service. It is probably one of the best Japanese restaurants in Chicago. We come here for anniversary or birthday dinners since it is a bit pricey for us for a weekly dinner, but well worth the price for a special night out. You have to make reservations way in advance to get a good time. Usually if you wait till the week of, you will only get early slots (before 5pm) or late slots (10pm). This last time my husband had the omakase, which he loved. I had the Yaki Soba with shrimp, which I also enjoyed.

Really good place if you enjoy creative and tasteful Japanese dishes. We had the v'day omasake and did not regret it at all. The place is fully booked so we just had 1 and a half hour to finish 10 courses, which was a bit too tight time wise.

If you're looking at this review, it's because you're thinking about eating here. Just do it already!

I've been here three times, originally prompted by my friends telling me all about their experiences. The chef's tasting menu has fantastic value if you're not a picky eater. As for my boyfriend, he would rather select what he eats for himself which he was very happy with. One of the dishes was an entree item that was like noodles, sauce, veggies, and meat and it was so good and their other entrees were well priced so we will be back for that sooner than waiting for something special to happen for their sushi!

Yelp did not lead us astray on this one.  Kai Zan was a totally awesome, unique experience.  They basically mash up sushi with a pre-fix dining experience and the result is perfect.  We did the 10 course tasting menu which is a total steal at $65/person.  It is a BYOB with a reasonable corkage fee, so overall I felt like it was a great deal.  My only caveat to people is that you do have to really love raw fish.  Because that is pretty much every course.  Suited me just fine, but if you're expecting a hibachi steak type entree, nope, courses 9 and 10 are just more raw fish.  But the fish was excellent quality and variety, super flavorful and prepared in all sorts of ways with different garnishes and presentations.  Service was on point, with the spacing of dishes absolutely perfect.  We went with a group of 4 and had a great little private-feeling booth.  All in all, the meal took 2 hours, which I thought was ideal.  By the end we were full without being miserably stuffed, and delightfully tipsy from the bottle of sake and bottle of champagne that we brought.  Highly recommend this spot!

Hands down my favorite restaurant in the world.  The atmosphere is laid-back but cute.  The twin brothers who own it are friendly, hospitable (one time they sent me a free dish because they saw me eyeing it from the sushi counter), and beyond good at what they do.  They provide quality cuts of sushi presented in unique and tasty combinations for such a reasonable price in the city.  You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't order the chef's omakese...only $60 for 9 filling courses of the best sushi you've ever eaten!   The polenta bites are my favorite dish, so I'd also recommend adding this to your omakese as they aren't included.  In addition, they are very accommodating to gluten free and pescatarian diets.  Over the holidays they host a drawing to give away 2 $150 gift cards.  My out of town friends always request Kai Zan when they visit.  Make sure you make a reservation well in advance.

Finally I got to try out this place for my birthday! Boy was it a treat!

My suggestion is to ask what the chef's choice includes and if it floats your boat, go for it! That was exactly what I did. This way you are able to try out a little bit of everything on their menu. You won't regret the decision, I promise. There was so much food and it almost seemed endless. In addition to the tasting menu, we ordered the uni toro tartare and dessert in the end. 

One of my favorite dish of the night was the uni toro tartare! I love the DIY concept to this dish, and it almost seem endless. You just need to work for your food. Mix the tartare together really good and channel your inner sushi chef to make your own rolls. 

As much of a turn off the time limit is when you make the reservations, I did not feel at all pressured during the service. We did take a bit of time to make a decision, but our server was very patient with us. He walked us through the menu and elaborated on any questions I had along with making great suggestions. 

The pace was on point, however my ONLY critic is that from sitting at the bar and seeing how the kitchen flowed, what I noticed was the timing and preparation of the food. Some of the hot food was sitting there longer than I would have liked it because when I got my food expecting it to be hot, it was warm, if not almost cold. Of the hot food, only the soup and dynamite mussel were actually hot. Everything else minus the raw stuff were almost cold, which was a bit disappointing. 

The concept of clean and simple flavors is what I left with at this place. The tasting menu flowed from simple to variety and back to simple again. Nothing distracted your palette of the original flavors. As the tasting menu ends with a showcasing a selection of sashimi, I thought was genius because the menu took you on such an adventure, but made sure to remind you of the origin with the main ingredients of the night, fish. Just the concept of something as simple as fish can be created and paired with different things, but yet alone it can still be appreciated. 

To end this wonderful experience, we had a cup of green tea (FREE) and Cashew Panna Cotta. Not too sweet or heavy. Simple but yet so many textures and layers involved in just a little dessert. It was the perfect way to celebrate my birthday dinner! Cheers.

Best Omakase Ever! 

I don't know why I didn't listen to everyone else in Chicago and made the trek to Kai Zan sooner. Like seriously, I've been missing out!!! I could write a book on how amazing it is, but please listen to the masses and come here pronto! 

Let me say that they have converted me to an uni lover. I have never really been a fan of uni and now I know it's because I've never had truly awesome uni. I love sushi and I'll even tolerate subpar sushi but really this is out of this world amazingly fresh and creatively composed sushi!!! 

I had their omakase with some food loving friends and now I feel like I can never go back and not get the omakase. It's worth every cent and the chef even added an extra course with an off the menu item that still makes my mouth water when I think about it. 

Service was amazing. They kept checking on us and explained every course that came out in detail. I have nothing bad to say. This is my new favorite for sushi!!!

Let me just start off by saying how amazing the hostess was! I couldn't make my 5:45pm reservation and called to cancel, as there were no open time slots until 9pm. Within 15 minutes, Maya called me back to inform me that they had a cancellation and she wanted to offer me that time slot!
The fish.... was the freshest I had ever had in Chicago. I have tried so many sushi restaurants but this was beyond what I expected. Angry crab, fiesta maki, flaming tuna, grilled hamachi nigiri and ebi sushi were all amazing! I could have this ebi sushi 1000 times!
I was so excited to try everything and ordered a ton of food... some of which I really shouldn't have... I would pass on the skewers and yaki soba but try as much sushi and sashimi as you can!

Zena is amazing. I was craving a vegan ramen fix, this place had exactly what I needed. 
The beau and I are  here from out of town and she made the experience what we wanted, down to a t. Definitely recommend this place, ask for her.
She knew it all and was able to satiate both of us, vegan and not.

My favorite ramen spot in Chicago. I've been here multiple times and have never been disappointed. Everything I've ordered has been delicious:
- Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen
- Spicy Ramen
- Chicken Karaage Don
- Pork Chashu Don
- Gyoza
- Edamame
- Takoyaki

The ramen is perfectly al dente, not like many ramen places that overcook it, and the soup is brimming with flavor. If you want to save money but still fill your belly, the rice bowls are the way to go (I'm always really full after eating them).

Apart from good food and the classy ramen shop vibe you would expect, Kizuki holds anime nights pretty frequently (yes, I may be biased because I love myself a good anime series and am obsessed with Ghibli films). Be aware that a lot of people make reservations for anime night. Even on a normal night, solid chance you'll have to wait for a table. Note that the waiting area isn't very big, so you'll have to wait outside if there are a ton of people.

Yo!!!!!!!!!! 
Whenever I come here it's a lot of good vibes. First time I came here, I brought a date and she liked it. Second time was with Obie squad and we went HAM, especially on those chicken wings. Today is probably the biggest one of all; joining me this time was none other than my sister and my mama. *Dun Dun DUN!!!!*

To start things off, if any of y'all are big on anime then you're in luck. When you enter the place, they have posters of famous movies that they play on Tuesday and Wednesday nights; from Kiki's Delivery Service, Spirited Away, Dragon Ball, and so much more. Now that's wassup! Always be on the look out for when you trying to see one of your favs. 

One thing my mom is big on is the customer service. If she like you, you Gucci. If not, oooooooooooooh watch out. Fortunately, the staff here is very nice and they make sure they keep it 100 with you. They're also very fast in serving the food. It was like a 5-10 min wait which was chill. They passed the mama test. 

For an appetizer, we got the chicken karaage. Lemme tell you, this is one of the most delicious chicken I've had-really crunchy on the inside and very juicy on the inside. It was a shame I had to share those 5 scrumptious pieces with my sis and mom otherwise I could've ate all of them. But sharing is caring I guess. We got our ramen and it was so good. I got the spicy ramen and it was a pretty good amount of heat but I needed more. They hooked me and my mom with that chili paste and made my tastebuds go on another level. That extra spice made me feel like I wasn't gang gang but I managed to pull through. My sis and mom got the veggie ramen and chicken shio ramen respectively. Our tummies were satisfied and full. 

A couple of things: 1. Make sure to take a lyft/uber because parking can be a mission. 2. They have a variety of beverages and great specials for them. 3. There's a ramen challenge for those that wanna go for it (Imma try to go for it one day and get recognized). Overall this place was dope and I will come back to try more dishes! This place is Gucci gang with me, my sis, and mama. #weouthere!!!

This may be one of the best ramen shops in the city.

The food is delicious and consistent. It's very respectable for a date, to bring out-of-town-guests and even for hangover food when you're in need of a hearty meal. 

This place has a good amount of hype but don't be discouraged by the appearance of the long line if you come without a reservation. The wait is actually a lot shorter than what I have ever been quoted and the actual wait for the meal isn't very long either. Be patient, it's definitely worth it. 

You cannot go wrong with their tonkatsu ramen or their takoyaki appetizer. 

I recently tried their gekikara ramen which was a part of their winter menu. I ended up adding tonkatsu broth to it to give it a bit more depth since the spice was mostly surface-level.

I liked this place! A lot! Might be my favorite Japanese Ramen place in the city. The contenders are Umai and Wasabi. But I think this place cracks top 3. I was pleasantly surprised! The servers are very friendly. They did screw up our appetizer order...it just never came out but whatever. We were so full from the ramen it didn't even matter. 

So we got 2 different ramens. We got the Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. On the menu they say it's limited quantity. Pretty sure they had plenty but who knows. Anyways if you like garlic and flavor, this is the ramen to get. I unfortunately love garlic and yeah I know stinky breath, whatever, wash it down with some alcohol, but damn it was legit! We also shared the Spicy Ramen. It's pretty simple, just called Spicy Ramen. Had a lot of flavors! It was good! Props for the atmosphere/interior of this place as well. It's really cool and gives off good energy.

All in all, I will definitely come back. I liked the ramen a lot. It's one of the best ones I've had in Chicago IMO and will continue to go back until I think otherwise!

Came here with a group of 3 on a Friday night and not surprisingly, it was pretty packed! We were told we would need to wait 45 min for a table but in the end we were seated in 15 min.

Our table ordered the croquette and karaage appetizers. The karaage was plated in big pieces and fried perfectly. The croquette was average--I thought it was covered in a little too much sauce. For our mains, we ordered 2 bowls of the Garlic Tonkotsu (less sodium) ramen and 1 bowl of the Miso Ramen. I thought the Garlic Tonkotsu broth was great! It was rich, milky and as promised, seasoned with quite a bit of garlic, which I liked. The noodles were on the edge of being too tough for me (a little more than Ramen Takeya, but less than Ramen-san), but still complemented the dish well. However, I didn't realize this until after my meal, but they forgot to put an egg in both of the garlic tonkotsu bowls for our table, which is rather disappointing.

What I do really like about Kizuki is the atmosphere and interior decor of the place. It fits the Wicker Park vibe pretty spot on and their frequent movie nights are really appealing. Overall, a pretty hip place to eat pretty good ramen!

Kizuki serves a really good ramen that is worth traveling for. I currently live in the South Loop but willing to travel 30 minutes on the CTA for this. I've gone here 3 times now and haven't been disappointed with their ramen. The quality of the Izakaya (I.e chicken wings) is good but not great. If you want chicken wings, go to En Hakkorre 2.0 which is a short walk nearby. 

Come for the ramen and great atmosphere. You won't be disappointed.

I get the shoyu less sodium and it's good but the chicken wings are AMAZING. The citrus sauce is mystical, the wings are huge, and the skin is crispy and light. My second trip here (pictured) was during happy hour. Really good $10 deal for all you can eat wings and a beer. Might even prefer wings over ramen. 

But overall the food is pretty good here and it's not unreasonably fusioned. At least the food is good and there's some truth to their ramen.

A decent ramen place in Wicker Park. I've been here a few times at this point. I won't rave that this is the best ramen I've ever had - that's false. I think if this place were located in Japan it'd be evaluated as average or just good at best. Within the US, it doesn't come close to the amazing Mega Ramen at Totto Ramen in NYC. 

But it's a reliable, consistent source of good ramen in Chicago. It's quite authentic though not outstanding. Recommend for curing your ramen cravings.

Tried the croquette appetizer, limited quantity garlic shoyu ramen, and chicken shoyu ramen. All of them were good, but just not impressive. The noodles were thinner in the chicken shoyu ramen and much more enjoyable. The broths were flavorful, but they only give you just enough to cover the noodles, probably for good reason (too thick and rich to have a whole bowlful). 

It was a good, warm meal for the day of the first snow in Chicago, 2017! :)

P.S. i love the complimentary mouthwash in the bathroom with the tiny cups!!!

Came to redeem my free ramen! But since there was a cubs game going on as well, they had a great wings deal. It was ayce wings with a glass of beer for about $10?? That's what my boyfriend got and he said it was pretty decent, nothing too special. For all you can eat, the refill was really slow, really really slow. It was a really busy night for them and they seem to me a bit understaffed because it looked like there was on,y 3 servers that night. Don't get me wrong our server was great and super accommodating but he was bussing so much tables, we kind of lost him through the night. But yeah the chicken wings took to long to come out. 

For the ramen, I wouldn't exactly say it's my favorite but it is not the worst. The broth itself was too much for my tasting but my boyfriend enjoyed it because of how flavorful it was but that was too much for me. Good location in wicker park because it's always so busy as well. Would come back on behalf of my boyfriend so pretty decent.

Love the service and atmosphere- everyone is super friendly and helpful.  I've gone here probably 4-5 times now and my experiences have been mixed.  On one hand I've had really good dipping noodles there but the other ramens with the broth are so salty!! I really need 2-3 glasses of water for one ramen bowl.  The flavors are nice and the noodles are perfect but the salt content really needs to be lowered.  The portion sizes are fair for myself but if u was a really hungry guy I think I would need extra noodles.  I prefer the ramen you can dip in the broth so you can control how much sodium you are consuming but on cold days I just want to slurp up an entire bowl of broth but sad I really can't do that here.  If they improved on this one thing I would definitely be back!

This is an authentic Japanese Ramen noodle restaurant. I am very happy to have such an authentic ramen restaurant in Chicago as I  used to go to CA or NY to find good Ramen places. Garlic Tonkotsu based soup was good. Noodles were fresh taste. It's a franchise restaurant from Japan.

After 9pm, beers and cocktails were only $1.00. I ordered some drink before 9pm but the wait staff told me it's better to wait until 9pm. How kind she was!

I definitely go back there again.

I really like it here! I have been on Friday and Saturday nights and it is usually busy. I made a reservation for a Friday night last week and we had to wait about five minutes for our table, which was fine. It shows how popular the place is. The ingredients all taste really fresh and everything has a lot of flavor. My party got the potato croquettes to share for an appetizer and the Yelp check in is free edamame. The croquettes were crispy and a little spicy which I liked. They were served on a bed of cabbage with a soy sauce type sauce. It is very tasty and got me excited for the ramen! The edamame are yummy too, salty and warm but not too salty. I got the vegetarian ramen with tofu. I really like the broth. My dining partner got one of the chicken ramen. I tried a taste of it but I was not a fan of the chicken broth. I love the veggie ramen at Kizuki, that is worth 4 stars on its own. The one thing is that I wish there were more non pork and vegetarian options, considering the fact that there is only one veggie ramen and one chicken ramen. Overall, I will definitely be back. It is the perfect cuisine for the chilly Chicago weather happening now and for the next six or so months.

Came here on a friday night and didn't have to wait for a table.  Got the garlic tonkotsu shoyu ramen, which came with pork and egg.  The pork wasn't amazing (didn't melt or fall apart in my mouth) but wasn't bad, but the soft boiled egg was amazing!  Perfectly runny on the inside, and the flavor of whatever it was boiled in on the outside.  The broth was also amazing, as well as the noodles.  The waitress brought me some spicy paste to in the ramen to make it spicy too, which was nice of her.  Would definitely come back more often, especially since it's right across from jeni's ice cream...

One thing that people might like about this place is that their ramen have a low-sodium option.  I've never tried it because I'm a full-sodium-till-I-die type of person, but I'm sure it floats other peoples' boats!

This is the best ramen I've had so far in the city of chicago, possibly the best in all of chicago area and trust me I've been to a lot. The noodles are cooked almost perfectly, and the broth is simply delicious, Nuff said.

Couple reasons why I'm not giving this 5 stars. First, I almost never give five stars, 4 stars is already very good for me, check out my other reviews and you'll see what I'm talking about. Second, it takes a while for the staff to seat you even if there are plenty of open spaces. 

The cheapest bowl of ramen here is $9 which is the cheapest I've found so far. While this does not come with a soft-boiled egg but its fine since I've learned how to make my own. 

One thing I love about this place is that there are 3 different kinds of noodles to choose from: thin, flat and wavy. I always ask the server to substitute for wavy since I prefer a thicker noodle, and they are very happy to do it for you just ask! And for those of you that don't like too salty, theres a low sodium option as well. 

I've been here 6 times over the past 3 months so that says how much I love this place. Definitely will make several trips back.

This is definitely the best ramen place in Chicago! I'm Japanese, so you can 100% trust me! 

Normally, ramen in Chicago is salty so I can't eat much but this place's ramen is perfect. All of the items (noodles, soup, toppings) in the ramen are perfectly balanced. This place is a lot better than mediocre ramen places in Japan. The best part of this place's ramen is the soup, and to really appreciate it, I highly recommend you try the Shio or Yuzu Shio Ramen. Basically, shio flavor is the most difficult flavor to make, but this place does it justice! 

The service is very prompt, and the staff is friendly and attentive. This place is without a doubt authentic and delicious. I will definitely come back here again sometime soon.

Decent ramen, fairly long wait times.

I came to Kizuki with a group of friends a while back and had a decent overall experience. We came on one of the Miyazaki nights, where they had a movie playing up on two screens. Unfortunately, from where we sat, we didn't have a good view of either screen, but that wasn't a big deal for us. There was quite a long wait, which made us both hungry and hopeful that this place would be bomb. 

I ordered the takoyaki, which was tasty but pretty standard. I also got the shoyu ramen. The noodles were great, with just the right amount of chewiness in their texture. The broth was ok--my friend ordered the garlic tonkotsu shoyu ramen, which had a much more flavorful broth. The pork belly was disappointing however-- not so much of a melt-in-your-mouth sensation as a tough-and-chewy one. Overall, decent food but not anything amazing. 

Service was decent, considering the restaurant was so busy. I might come back again, but I felt like Kizuki didn't really stand out in any aspect, so maybe not.

My favorite ramen place in Chicago thus far! The food was good and service was friendly and fast. For starters we had the chicken karage and pork buns. Then we had the spicy ramen and garlic tonkatsu ramen. The broth was savory and rich. We got the low sodium option and it was just right. I highly recommend all the dishes we had today. Will definitely be visiting again soon!

I'm not all surprised after reading the great reviews.   The place was crowded even on a Monday evening.  My friend had the veggie ramen with extra tofu and I opted for the spicy ramen.  

The broth was well seasoned and flavorful.  My noodle was perfectly cooked with a bite to it.  I love the fact that they have white pepper on the table for me to kick my ramen another notch.  

Our waitress was very friendly and personal.  She made sure my friend and I are happy with our orders.

I enjoyed my bowl of goodness and I will definitely come back to try others.

Came to redeem my free ramen! But since there was a cubs game going on as well, they had a great wings deal. It was ayce wings with a glass of beer for about $10?? That's what my boyfriend got and he said it was pretty decent, nothing too special. For all you can eat, the refill was really slow, really really slow. It was a really busy night for them and they seem to me a bit understaffed because it looked like there was on,y 3 servers that night. Don't get me wrong our server was great and super accommodating but he was bussing so much tables, we kind of lost him through the night. But yeah the chicken wings took to long to come out. 

For the ramen, I wouldn't exactly say it's my favorite but it is not the worst. The broth itself was too much for my tasting but my boyfriend enjoyed it because of how flavorful it was but that was too much for me. Good location in wicker park because it's always so busy as well. Would come back on behalf of my boyfriend so pretty decent.

Love the service and atmosphere- everyone is super friendly and helpful.  I've gone here probably 4-5 times now and my experiences have been mixed.  On one hand I've had really good dipping noodles there but the other ramens with the broth are so salty!! I really need 2-3 glasses of water for one ramen bowl.  The flavors are nice and the noodles are perfect but the salt content really needs to be lowered.  The portion sizes are fair for myself but if u was a really hungry guy I think I would need extra noodles.  I prefer the ramen you can dip in the broth so you can control how much sodium you are consuming but on cold days I just want to slurp up an entire bowl of broth but sad I really can't do that here.  If they improved on this one thing I would definitely be back!

This is an authentic Japanese Ramen noodle restaurant. I am very happy to have such an authentic ramen restaurant in Chicago as I  used to go to CA or NY to find good Ramen places. Garlic Tonkotsu based soup was good. Noodles were fresh taste. It's a franchise restaurant from Japan.

After 9pm, beers and cocktails were only $1.00. I ordered some drink before 9pm but the wait staff told me it's better to wait until 9pm. How kind she was!

I definitely go back there again.

I really like it here! I have been on Friday and Saturday nights and it is usually busy. I made a reservation for a Friday night last week and we had to wait about five minutes for our table, which was fine. It shows how popular the place is. The ingredients all taste really fresh and everything has a lot of flavor. My party got the potato croquettes to share for an appetizer and the Yelp check in is free edamame. The croquettes were crispy and a little spicy which I liked. They were served on a bed of cabbage with a soy sauce type sauce. It is very tasty and got me excited for the ramen! The edamame are yummy too, salty and warm but not too salty. I got the vegetarian ramen with tofu. I really like the broth. My dining partner got one of the chicken ramen. I tried a taste of it but I was not a fan of the chicken broth. I love the veggie ramen at Kizuki, that is worth 4 stars on its own. The one thing is that I wish there were more non pork and vegetarian options, considering the fact that there is only one veggie ramen and one chicken ramen. Overall, I will definitely be back. It is the perfect cuisine for the chilly Chicago weather happening now and for the next six or so months.

Came here on a friday night and didn't have to wait for a table.  Got the garlic tonkotsu shoyu ramen, which came with pork and egg.  The pork wasn't amazing (didn't melt or fall apart in my mouth) but wasn't bad, but the soft boiled egg was amazing!  Perfectly runny on the inside, and the flavor of whatever it was boiled in on the outside.  The broth was also amazing, as well as the noodles.  The waitress brought me some spicy paste to in the ramen to make it spicy too, which was nice of her.  Would definitely come back more often, especially since it's right across from jeni's ice cream...

One thing that people might like about this place is that their ramen have a low-sodium option.  I've never tried it because I'm a full-sodium-till-I-die type of person, but I'm sure it floats other peoples' boats!

This is the best ramen I've had so far in the city of chicago, possibly the best in all of chicago area and trust me I've been to a lot. The noodles are cooked almost perfectly, and the broth is simply delicious, Nuff said.

Couple reasons why I'm not giving this 5 stars. First, I almost never give five stars, 4 stars is already very good for me, check out my other reviews and you'll see what I'm talking about. Second, it takes a while for the staff to seat you even if there are plenty of open spaces. 

The cheapest bowl of ramen here is $9 which is the cheapest I've found so far. While this does not come with a soft-boiled egg but its fine since I've learned how to make my own. 

One thing I love about this place is that there are 3 different kinds of noodles to choose from: thin, flat and wavy. I always ask the server to substitute for wavy since I prefer a thicker noodle, and they are very happy to do it for you just ask! And for those of you that don't like too salty, theres a low sodium option as well. 

I've been here 6 times over the past 3 months so that says how much I love this place. Definitely will make several trips back.

This is definitely the best ramen place in Chicago! I'm Japanese, so you can 100% trust me! 

Normally, ramen in Chicago is salty so I can't eat much but this place's ramen is perfect. All of the items (noodles, soup, toppings) in the ramen are perfectly balanced. This place is a lot better than mediocre ramen places in Japan. The best part of this place's ramen is the soup, and to really appreciate it, I highly recommend you try the Shio or Yuzu Shio Ramen. Basically, shio flavor is the most difficult flavor to make, but this place does it justice! 

The service is very prompt, and the staff is friendly and attentive. This place is without a doubt authentic and delicious. I will definitely come back here again sometime soon.

The ramen here is amazing. One of the best spicy tonkatsu I have ever had. Next time I visit Chicago, I would love to go here again. 

The spicy ramen is delicious. The broth is rich, creamy, strong flavors from the many spices used, and has a light texture with bits of breading of some sort floating in it. 

The chashu pork was cooked perfect - juicy and full of flavor. The egg was also done just right - nice and gooey in the center. 

They use egg noodles, and you can choose what thickness you want. I went with their default option, the thick noodles. They are great quality noodles. You really can't go wrong with thick egg noodle. 

They won best ramen in Chicago in 2016, and for a good reason. I can't wait to come back.

Food, delicious. Service, not so hot. 

First time I came here, my friend and I stood by the hostess area for a good 5 minute, with waiters seeing us and just passing by, not saying a word to us. Albeit, it was quite busy during that time, but they could have at least told us that they'd be right with us. This past week when I stopped in again, they seated us right away, but were slow to get back to us to get our order, etc. I would definitely give 5 stars if their service was just even a tad better.

Food-wise, I have been satisfied both times. I don't remember exactly what I got the first time, but it was some ramen and it was delicious. The second time however was much more memorable as to what I ordered. My friend and I ordered the Tsukemen dipping noodles with Tonkatsu broth. It looked and was delicious. Dipping the noodles into the broth made a huge difference. The broth was very flavorful and had a tiny kick at the end. It came with some vegetables, bamboo, and meat, that honestly weren't that great. The only criticism I would have about the noodles is that they seemed to have it already prepared and had the noodles sitting out for too long because a lot of them were stuck together.

Located in the heart of Wicker Park, there's no lack of good eats around the area. But if you're craving ramen, stopping by Kizuki is certainly a solid choice. 

The decor is modern, not unlike what you'd see from other ramen spots in Chicago. They have a text messaging reservation system, so you'll get a text when your table is ready. We barely had to wait 5 mins on a Friday night for a party of 3. Service was good, but I feel like the ramen here took longer to come out than expected.

We all opted for the garlic tonkotsu shoyu ramen and had no regrets. The egg was perfectly softboiled, the noodles a perfect balance between chewy and firm, and the broth not too salty yet flavorful still. It satisfied my ramen craving but nothing life-changing. Would've been happier with a larger portion of ramen... but I think that's just me being a piggy hah

We also really liked the chicken karaage!

Considering I just got back from Japan, I had high expectations of this ramen shop. Happy to report that this place is the real deal (and even has locations in Japan!) 

My friends and I had to wait about 45 min for a table on Friday night, which I didn't think was too bad. Once we were seated, we quickly decided to split the Chicken Karaage, which wasn't quite as good as it was overseas, but still simply delicious-crispy coating, tender chicken, and mouth-watering flavor. 

I went with the garlic tonkotsu, which after first bite, whisked me back to my trip. The traditional broth I opted for wasn't too salty and had a good flavor, the noodles were cooked well, and everything about it was fantastic. I finished the entire bowl I had absolutely no regrets. 

If you're looking for authentic ramen, hands down this is the spot. So glad I discovered this gem!

I think this is the best Ramen joint in Wicker Park (the others being Oiistar and Furious Spoon) and one of the best in the greater Chicago area.  

I'm usually a tonkatsu ramen kind of person and judge ramen on the broth, noodles, accompanying meat, and other accoutrement (in that order).  Their tonkatsu and extra garlic tonkatsu are both excellent here.  The broth is creamy and unctuous, their noodles are good and it's got the nicely cooked soft boiled egg among other things.  Pork in it is nice and tender too.  

Nice beer and drink selection, although their take on the old fashioned (can't remember name) is something I would avoid as it just seems kinda like a high end punch.  

Overall this is my go to ramen place and the food is always consistent (unlike Oiistar which has just gone down over time).  I would give this place 4.5 stars as it's not quite up there with Santouka Ramen (hands down favorite).

Had been awhile since I've had ramen that I really enjoyed and Kizuki did the job. I ended up getting the spiciest ramen and not to sound cliche but for their spiciest, I was expecting a bit more of a kick. It was really good regardless and the ingredients felt fresh and were seasoned well. I wanted to give it four stars for some reason, but why? Like if you think about it, how good can the greatest ramen in the world be right? Anyways, that's a debate for another day

We hardly had to wait for our food which was surprising, but had ordered some saki as we waited based off of the waitress' recommendation. The staff was pretty sweet and the atmosphere was really nice. They had all these posters for anime they show here i guess regularly? don't quote me, but it seems pretty cool if they do. 

This was my first ramen experience in chicago, but i'm excited to compare to other places going forward.

First impression: authentic feel that reminds me of my time in Japan. Miso Spicy ramen was pretty good, but I prefer Hi-Five ramen noodle texture and meat better. 

Best non-food features: "Irasshaimase!" (), location is accessible, near funky, vintage shops and my favorite MoJo Spa

The service with a smile was the best!

I came in on a briskly cold Sunday around 5 p.m.; as it was just me, the wait was non-existent since I sat at the bar, but worth noting that even at 5 p.m. there were folks waiting for a table!  So this place certainly gets busy.

I got the spicy ramen (heat level: regular), subbing in the tofu for the meat, and adding mushrooms.

The broth is. SO. GOOD.  Holy moly.  Also, I've had ramen plenty of times, but I've never been a huge fan of the soft-boiled egg in my ramen - the flavor profile has never "meshed" with the rest of the ramen before - until Kizuki.  The egg was perfectly soft boiled and marinated such that it went wonderfully with my ramen.

I'm glad I chose the "regular" heat level because it was the perfect balance of spicy without being overwhelmingly so, and I could still enjoy the base flavors.

I drained my bowl to the last drop, slurping contentedly the whole way.

Cannot recommend this place enough!

We came here for my friend's birthday. There was 15 of us and I was very surprised they took reservations especially for such a big group! We were all able to sit next to each other, too. My husband and I went to the Kizuki in Seattle before and we enjoyed the food there. We feel the same way about this Chicago location as well. The service was decent given there were 2 toddlers and so many adults. I enjoyed my noodle.. I ordered pork gyozas and the Japanese pork bun for my 18 month old toddler who ate it all! One of the wait staff (I didn't catch her name but she has green hair) was very nice and accommodating. She offered to give us more spoons since my son kept tossing the utensils and napkins. I was a bit worried this place wouldn't be kid friendly given the location and how hip it is, but I'm happy to say that I have no worry about bringing my child here again next time. Thanks!

Been here a couple times now and it has never been a disappointment. The awesome part is that they have a low sodium option. It was the perfect broth! Also, The chicken Karaage is a must! Although I'd stay away from the takoyaki (I think that was the name. They were the octopus balls)

Hands down my favorite ramen spot in Chicago. The West Loop has some great spots too but this is so much more central & everything about Kizuki is 10/10. 

The noodles are perfectly cooked (a bit el dente, not too soft), the egg is soft but the yolk doesn't spill too much (sorry Furious Spoon, but I don't like a soupy egg), and the pork is tender and pulls apart. There are plenty of toppings and the broth is delicious. 

I have tried the shoyu ramen, garlic, and spicy ramen and would highly recommend the spicy ramen. It's my favorite by far!

The staff here was incredibly attentive and kind. My water was constantly refilled and my bowl of ramen came out very quickly! Plus, come during happy hour & get a beer for only $1. ($15 for ramen and beer? Count me in!)

Kizuki ranks as one of my Top 3 Ramen places in town. I had the Garlic Tonkatsu Ramen, and it was delicious.  The broth was my favorite as it was flavorful and complemented the noodle well. The egg was done right, soft but not too gooey. The pork belly was also good although I would say that I've had it better. Overall, I would give their ramen 4.5/5.

What I enjoyed the most with this place is that everything we tried on their menu was excellent.  Chicken Karaage was so good and perfectly fried. The drunken gummy bears was fun to try, and their sangria was perfect for a nice summer day. On top of that, the staff  provided friendly and attentive service.

GO WITH LOW SODIUM BROTH!!!

Third visit last night, and I feel confident to say I would recommend this place with confidence to friends. The food has been consistently well-prepared and all-around delicious. Service has consistently been quick and very friendly, super-helpful with suggestions and menu clarification. 

My favorite ramen is their signature Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyo, to which I always add the pork belly. A BIG tip that our server told me the first time, is that she recommends getting the LOW SODIUM version. At first, I was unsure, as I was afraid it would be a little bland, but I am glad I listened. It is so flavorable regardless, that the only thing I have to add is a few drops of chili oil, and the broth is perfect, rich-porky goodness. My friend got the same dish last night, and I told him to get the low sodium version, but he forgot this when ordering and he did, indeed, say it was a bit too salty for him.

I have tried the Pork Chashu Don, and it was pretty flavorful, but while here, I think the ramen is too good to go with anything else. Karaage chicken is basically perfectly battered and cooked chicken tenders served with spicy mayo, and it's awesome. Girlfriend and I get them every time we go. The Octopus dumplings I'm not crazy about. Excellent presentation, with an almost alive-looking 'skin' on top and colorful sauce drizzling, but for me, it's basically a hush-puppy with octopus chunks inside. My girlfriend likes them, however, so...

Not sure how this stacks up against Furious Spoon, or others in the immediate area, but I can say I liked it better than the ramen at Umai (which is good, to be clear).

Staffs here gives off the friendliest vibes i've ever received at any other Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya. You can tell the people working there loves their job and have a passion for the food industry. 

With a classy bar in the back, the whole restaurant was kept clean. (Including the bathroom) guests were seated as soon as they came in and food arrived hot and fast. 

Best kizuki ramen experience by far.

Oh, if you're trying to get tipsy without dealing with the alcohol kick, their gummy bears are BOMB. Doubtful at first but it sure got us feeling great

I think this is the best Ramen joint in Wicker Park (the others being Oiistar and Furious Spoon) and one of the best in the greater Chicago area.  

I'm usually a tonkatsu ramen kind of person and judge ramen on the broth, noodles, accompanying meat, and other accoutrement (in that order).  Their tonkatsu and extra garlic tonkatsu are both excellent here.  The broth is creamy and unctuous, their noodles are good and it's got the nicely cooked soft boiled egg among other things.  Pork in it is nice and tender too.  

Nice beer and drink selection, although their take on the old fashioned (can't remember name) is something I would avoid as it just seems kinda like a high end punch.  

Overall this is my go to ramen place and the food is always consistent (unlike Oiistar which has just gone down over time).  I would give this place 4.5 stars as it's not quite up there with Santouka Ramen (hands down favorite).

Had been awhile since I've had ramen that I really enjoyed and Kizuki did the job. I ended up getting the spiciest ramen and not to sound cliche but for their spiciest, I was expecting a bit more of a kick. It was really good regardless and the ingredients felt fresh and were seasoned well. I wanted to give it four stars for some reason, but why? Like if you think about it, how good can the greatest ramen in the world be right? Anyways, that's a debate for another day

We hardly had to wait for our food which was surprising, but had ordered some saki as we waited based off of the waitress' recommendation. The staff was pretty sweet and the atmosphere was really nice. They had all these posters for anime they show here i guess regularly? don't quote me, but it seems pretty cool if they do. 

This was my first ramen experience in chicago, but i'm excited to compare to other places going forward.

First impression: authentic feel that reminds me of my time in Japan. Miso Spicy ramen was pretty good, but I prefer Hi-Five ramen noodle texture and meat better. 

Best non-food features: "Irasshaimase!" (), location is accessible, near funky, vintage shops and my favorite MoJo Spa

The service with a smile was the best!
Mouthwash in the bathroom???Yes!

I came in on a briskly cold Sunday around 5 p.m.; as it was just me, the wait was non-existent since I sat at the bar, but worth noting that even at 5 p.m. there were folks waiting for a table!  So this place certainly gets busy.

I got the spicy ramen (heat level: regular), subbing in the tofu for the meat, and adding mushrooms.

The broth is. SO. GOOD.  Holy moly.  Also, I've had ramen plenty of times, but I've never been a huge fan of the soft-boiled egg in my ramen - the flavor profile has never "meshed" with the rest of the ramen before - until Kizuki.  The egg was perfectly soft boiled and marinated such that it went wonderfully with my ramen.

I'm glad I chose the "regular" heat level because it was the perfect balance of spicy without being overwhelmingly so, and I could still enjoy the base flavors.

I drained my bowl to the last drop, slurping contentedly the whole way.

Cannot recommend this place enough!

We came here for my friend's birthday. There was 15 of us and I was very surprised they took reservations especially for such a big group! We were all able to sit next to each other, too. My husband and I went to the Kizuki in Seattle before and we enjoyed the food there. We feel the same way about this Chicago location as well. The service was decent given there were 2 toddlers and so many adults. I enjoyed my noodle.. I ordered pork gyozas and the Japanese pork bun for my 18 month old toddler who ate it all! One of the wait staff (I didn't catch her name but she has green hair) was very nice and accommodating. She offered to give us more spoons since my son kept tossing the utensils and napkins. I was a bit worried this place wouldn't be kid friendly given the location and how hip it is, but I'm happy to say that I have no worry about bringing my child here again next time. Thanks!

Been here a couple times now and it has never been a disappointment. The awesome part is that they have a low sodium option. It was the perfect broth! Also, The chicken Karaage is a must! Although I'd stay away from the takoyaki (I think that was the name. They were the octopus balls)

Hands down my favorite ramen spot in Chicago. The West Loop has some great spots too but this is so much more central & everything about Kizuki is 10/10. 

The noodles are perfectly cooked (a bit el dente, not too soft), the egg is soft but the yolk doesn't spill too much (sorry Furious Spoon, but I don't like a soupy egg), and the pork is tender and pulls apart. There are plenty of toppings and the broth is delicious. 

I have tried the shoyu ramen, garlic, and spicy ramen and would highly recommend the spicy ramen. It's my favorite by far!

The staff here was incredibly attentive and kind. My water was constantly refilled and my bowl of ramen came out very quickly! Plus, come during happy hour & get a beer for only $1. ($15 for ramen and beer? Count me in!)

Kizuki ranks as one of my Top 3 Ramen places in town. I had the Garlic Tonkatsu Ramen, and it was delicious.  The broth was my favorite as it was flavorful and complemented the noodle well. The egg was done right, soft but not too gooey. The pork belly was also good although I would say that I've had it better. Overall, I would give their ramen 4.5/5.

What I enjoyed the most with this place is that everything we tried on their menu was excellent.  Chicken Karaage was so good and perfectly fried. The drunken gummy bears was fun to try, and their sangria was perfect for a nice summer day. On top of that, the staff  provided friendly and attentive service.

This place had been on my list for a while, so I was excited we were able to X it off over the weekend. Sadly, we were quite disappointed. My boyfriend and I are huge ramen-goers and this place just didn't stand up to the competition. With Oystar and Furious all within a close walk, I don't think we will ever be back to Kizuki--there are just better options elsewhere. 

A couple of main reasons for the 2 stars...

-We had a bug on our table! Seriously a frickin bug crawling around on our soy sauce holder. Gross!

- My friend ordered the pork bun and it was completely inedible. The piece of pork was 95% fat, and she had to pull it apart leaving maybe 1 bite worth.

-The noodles were good, but the broth and toppings were just OK. Definitely have had more flavorful ramens  in the city. The pork was so thin it was really tough

I got the garlic ramen with pork belly and edamame. The ramen was fantastic. The broth wasn't too salty and the favors with really good. It wasnt clear if meat came with the ramen i ordered, it wasnt listed as having meat on the menu so thats why I ordered the pork belly. But it was served with pork and the pork bellt came out like 10 monutes after the ramen. If I go back I probably won't get The pork belly because, whole it was good, it didn't add much to the dish. Also that service here was pretty slow. It took us forever to get out check and to go containers.

Furious spoon or kizuki?  It's hard to say.  If you're having a hard time selecting one or walking a little further down the street, stop reading now because this review will not provide any insight.

Prices are similar, Furious spoon is slightly less.  Kizuki is like a normal moderately nice restaurant with normal dining tables and wait service.  Furious spoon has community tables and you order upon entering and take a number.  Overall I was please with the ramen from both establishments.

So why the 3 stars.  Well.  I understand ramen is a difficult feat but I also know that the broth is made ahead of time because it's not possible to make it from scratch with each order.  What I don't understand is why it literally took an hour for us to get our food?  The wait for the ramen didn't bother me as much as the wait for the free edamame with a facebook like.  I had to ask our waitress and several other people over five times!  After the third request for edamame I didn't even want it anymore, it was the principle.  When it did arrive, approximately 15 minutes after received our meals, I expected fresh grown edamame from kizuki's back alley.  Nope!  I have microwaved frozen edamame before and this was definitely over microwaved frozen edamame.

Other than the edamame scandal everything was great.  Our waitress was nice.  She often refilled our complimentary green teas and was as attentive as she needed to be.  I ordered the Yuzu Shio Ramen which is the chicken/Japanese citrus base broth.  It was so refreshing and not as salty as the tonkotsu broth that I'm typically used to.  This soup also came with charred pork which had an amazing flavor to it!

This place is obviously authentic. I opted for the dip noodle, as I have never tried this style before. The flavor is still very good. But it is just too rich to me. I felt I had to take half an hour to adjust after I had the noodles. My brain felt like been infused with pork fat. 

The fried chicken and agi tofu were pretty good though. The service and decor were excellent. I like the mouth wash in the bathroom.

Although Kizuki has authentic ramen in Chicago, I thought my ramen was decent. I had the shoyu ramen, and I wasn't crazy about it. The noodles were fine, but it seemed like something was missing. Broth tasted basic. Very simple toppings. I wish they added more to the dish to make it more exciting. Maybe I should've tried a different ramen. But the takoyaki was spot on.  I would've gone for more appetizers, maybe a karaage.

Ordered delivery from here the other day through grubhub. Unfortunately, it took about an extra hour from the estimated time we were given so we were super hungry by the time it got here. Aside from that, they do have a decent selection of ramen but I decided on the garlic tonkotsu shoyu. It came with pork chashu, half-boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, scallions, and a shoyu pork broth with garlic.

We followed the instructions that came with the bag for the best taste by microwaving the broth for a minute and then the other ingredients for another minute. I'm all about an oozing egg yolk when it comes to ramen so I was a bit worried at first since we microwaved it, but ended up being cooked perfectly. Props to them on that. The pork was delicious and the noodles were just firm enough. However, the broth had great flavors but was extremely SALTY, which is my main complaint. They give a decent portion for their take-out orders, I was quite full afterwards. Overall, pretty good ramen and would love to try to dine in next time.

This place had been recommended by the BF, who knows how much I love ramen. However, I was so disappointed the first time that I couldn't even bring myself to write a review. While I liked the aesthetics of the restaurant, there was good service, and the food came fast, I was not so pleased by the ramen itself.

Since I wasn't feeling the best, I didn't want anything too heavy, so I chose the Yuzu Shio Ramen hoping for something a little cleaner. I usually like the citrus-y flavors, but I think it was a little overdone in the ramen. Furthermore, the ramen was so incredibly salty--no wonder they offer a low-sodium option. The thing that bothered me most was how pricey the ramen was for how little quantity was given. There were very few toppings that came with the basic bowl, and any additional toppings were $1.50 each. I've definitely had way more rounded ramen for a cheaper price.

However, the BF insisted I give this place another try, and since it claims to be the best in Chicago, I thought I would go in to get their recommended ramen. So I came back and ordered the Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. The broth was much better, but again, very salty and still quite stingy on the toppings provided.

Overall, I really wanted to like Kizuki, but I think first impressions are hard to erase, and I just can't get over my first subpar experience.

My boyfriend and I went on a Friday early evening and it was not busy at all. We had an early dinner. It was quiet and casual. Lots of posters in the entry way so always something to see when waiting for a table.

First, we started off with chicken wings and they were delicious! It was hot and fresh! Seasoning was perfect. Not too rich, not too bland. Very crunchy and well cooked. They provided some hand wipes too

I had the spicy miso ramen and it was so good! It wasn't really spicy though.. but that's okay! The broth was rich so make sure to not slurp too much of just the broth. I felt as if it was getting a bit salty so I made sure to always have some corn or noodles with a spoonful of broth. 
It was a good portion between noodles and the toppings. Just the noodles and veggies alone was filling. I couldn't finish the pork so my boyfriend ate it.

He got a pork rice dish(I don't remember the name of it). The portion size for that was kinda off. He was left with a lot of rice. Like a lot. Even with my slice of pork, he left a lot of rice in the bowl. I had some of the rice alone and it wasn't as seasoned as I thought it would be. It looked like it was mixed with sesame oil and green onion to me, but still very little flavor. 

Overall, very good experience. We'll definitely come back and try the other dishes! Service was good too! Waiter/waitress always made sure we had water and came to check in on us and how our food was periodically but not in an annoying way. 

Something very interesting I noticed was in the bathroom lol they had a portable mouthwash pump. I didn't use it but I thought it was very unique hehe never saw anything like it before :P

I am a ramen lover, but always find it hard to find good places. This was a good place. I particularly love their broths, but I also really enjoyed the way the other components complemented each other. 
They have a low-sodium broth, which is a plus! However, I felt their portions were very small compared to other ramen places I've been to. Will go there again if in need of a ramen-fix!

We have experienced "Indian summer" for this Autumn season.  Oh, speaking of which, Chicago Cubs are the 2016 World Series champion.  Although there are some hot spots in Wrigleyville I would like to visit, hubby and I hanged out at "Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya" in Wicker Park instead.  

Nevertheless, winners or losers, men or women, boys or girls, all mankind should invite themselves to a nice bowl of ramen.  "Kizuki" is a chain originated in Tokyo, and now they have many locations worldwide.  Their menu is written in three (3) languages: English, Japanese, and Chinese.  Pictures of different ramen are featured so that you know what to expect and determine the extra toppings or add-ons you would like.  

Our server, Candy, also informed us the "happy hours" on their alcoholic beverages (Sundays-Thursdays: 5-7pm; Fridays-Saturdays: 2-5pm, 5-10pm).  I'm one of the strange individuals who dislike pairing alcohol with food (I know, I know...I've been ridiculed many times), but I understand for all you "happy hour hoppers," I bet you will find this useful.  

I went with the low sodium yuzu shio ramen.  I thought it was a thoughtful move for a patron to customize the sodium level he or she desired because I knew it could be excruciating to try to finish up a bowl of ramen that was WAY too salty.  Unfortunately, drinking an excessive amount of water certainly didn't offset all that brackish taste left in the mouth.  

The flavor of broth for my yuzu shio was very pleasant, but I was quite impressed by hubby's rich chicken ramen.  The broth was bold and concentrated.  I believe I've mentioned this several times in other reviews of mine: hubby has a pork allergy/intolerance.  "Kizuki" does offer non-pork ramen alternatives, just in case you ever wonder.  

The portion size for a bowl wasn't large, but it was adequate enough to fill us up.  

The cost of these two (2) bowls of ramen was right under $28 pre-tip.  We also received a coupon of $5 off when ordering any ramen plus izakaya.  Alright, the restaurant coupon strategy often entices me to come back because I'm good at keeping up with a miscellany of discount cards.  

P.s. there's complimentary mouthwash in the restroom.  Cool, because chewing mint or gum alone doesn't really work.

This will be a place that I will be back to update the review, but as of now, it's getting 3 stars until it can make it a place that I long for.
The real rating is: 3.5 stars
When: Wednesday lunch

This is a Japanese chain that is expanding in the USA. 
What I liked: they have low sodium and regular options for their ramen. Never experience that super salty unbearable ramen again!

Low sodium garlic tonkotsu shoyu ramen: you know how a person tries hard but not hard enough 100%? That's what the ramen experience felt.  Fullness in your mouth, and true to low sodium, was not overly salty. Could definitely taste the garlic. Noodles had good texture. Chashu was okay. Added pork belly for $2 - tender, worth it to add. They give you literally a 1.5in x 3in piece of nori though. Seriously? ugh, annoying. Portion was nice for me, but the average male would need supplemental noodles or a side. 

Takoyaki (fried octopus balls but they're listed as dumplings on the menu) - wouldn't order again. Felt pretty doughy and once you eat 2, you've pretty much had enough. I didn't even bother bringing leftovers home.

Bottom line: Need more info. I'll have to go back to try the other ramen before deciding if this is just another ramen "blip" on the map or a must-go for ramen lovers.

I've been wanting to try the place. It was easy for me and my friend to get in without having to wait. We started with the Chicken Karaage. They were deep fried chicken with a spicy mayo.  Great to share. I had the Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. I had it served with extra pork belly added. The broth was so flavorful. The noodles were good, but better if they were made in house. The egg was amazing. Whole and perfectly soft boiled. I'll definitely be back.  Up there with some of my favorite ramen places.

Chicago is boomin with ramen shops all over. Of course, I make my way to over to try out the brothy goodness that is ramen. 

Kizuki has quite a few broth flavors. I went with my family and we ordered 3 different kinds - Tonkatsu Garlic, Miso and Chicken. Surprisingly, the miso turns out to be my favorite of the bunch. Tonkatsu garlic, while I love them both, almost had too much of a smoky kick that it made it harder to taste the sweetness of the pork. Chicken has almost a slight gaminess to it with that slight funk, which I normally enjoy, but lacks that sweet savoriness of chicken. The noodles are also pretty good and they come in different styles as well. The egg is really orange and is really well done, especially if you like an ooey, gooey egg. Overall, I finished feeling satisfied, but I'm not sure if I got that crave, but that egg though... pretty good.

Service was fantastic. Nice that they gave us extra bowls to do our ramen taste test and we didn't even had to request it. Takoyaki and fried chicken karage were just ok, didn't quite hit the spot for me.

I go here often bc I am in the neighborhood and it is my fav ramen place, but Im disappointed nowadays by its service. Seems like all the staff and cooks are too busy or not organized. 

The door entrance is extremely heavy as if you are pushing a rock door. 

Also once they forgot to order my appetizer. Yesterday, they made the noodle really really sticky I thought I was eating starch. They remade the ramen but I wasnt happy. 

Also, I saw this ad on their window and they confirmed that I will get the ice cream when I entered. I like green tea ice cream so was  excited. However after eating they said, "Oh, the machine is broken and we have to fix it. Do you want to wait for 15-20 mins?" Are you kidding me.... I already ate all my ramen and so on so I wont wait for the ice cream. Sounds like they never make the machine work. They should just take off the ad and not over promise.

Finally the link here in Yelp in the "summer special" section didnt work. I told the staff about it and he didnt care to fix or appreciated that I told him that.

Came here before happy hour was over! Phew! We were able to order a few appetizer before the hour was up. They had a neat DEAL for the summer. Happy hour for $9.99 to have AYCE chicken wings with one sappora. I thought that sounded awesome, but this was my first time here so I wanted to get the ramen. I was able to order a happy hour chicken wing and the garlic shoyu  ramen with low sodium. The chicken wing is exactly what they describe in their description. Sour but had a sweet garlic taste in a way. I think I would of enjoy the AYCE, but at a different time. The ramen was really good for something that was low sodium. The EGG WAS AMAZiNG! It just melted in your mouth and the yolk itself was perfect. Even the quality of the pork slice that was in it was amazing. When my friends found out we could substitute  certain items, we sure did! since some of us did not like bamboo shoots in our ramen. During happy hour, order a signature ramen and you get a sappora for $1! My friend was able to do that. I was not sure if it was busy, but the sappora came out last? We believe the waiter perhaps forgot about it but he was kind enough to give us a second sappora on the house.

I love how they have movie night! I really like anime and anything Japanese so when they were playing movies, I loved it. The waiters were very attentive. They noticed we were trying to watch the movie through their bamboo curtain and was kind enough to pick it up for us.

Would come here again

After searching and searching to find that "one" ramen spot in Chicago, I think I can finally settle down on a winner here at Kizuki.

This modern Japanese restaurant and izakaya plays on my love for these noodles. Reuniting with a friend whom I've spent a year abroad in Sendai with, she suggested taking me here since it had become one of her favorites. I can see why- it is really good!

We started off with their karaage, which came in large, juicy pieces. The batter reminded me of Chinese fried chicken so I was a definite fan.

The real winner here was the Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. While heavily pork-broth based as its name implies, the mix of shoyu gave it an extra kick. I was impressed with the broth especially with the garlic components within. The noodles were great being just firm enough, the egg was perfectly cooked, and the chashu was breaking apart as I was moving it closer to my mouth. It was delicious!

This bowl of heaven is a must for anyone looking to taste some good quality ramen in the Midwest. I will definitely be back the next time I am craving some good ol' Japanese comfort food.

It was my first time here. I liked the ambience was very nice but Ramen was unimpressed. My husband and I ordered 4 appetizers and 2 Ramens. All the appetizers was just okay nothing interested. I ordered Miso Ramen ( spicy ) but not spicy at all and the broth was too savory. Portion and the price was reasonable. Service was excellent!

I went to this place by myself on a Friday night without a reservation. 
I am a ramen lover, but always find it hard to find good places. This was a good place. I particularly love their broths, but I also really enjoyed the way the other components complemented each other. 
They have a low-sodium broth, which is a plus! However, I felt their portions were very small compared to other ramen places I've been to. Will go there again if in need of a ramen-fix!

Tried the chicken rich ramen and wow! It was so delicious and a great alternatively to the usual pork option. It was very hardy without being heavy. The bamboo shoots were a little tart and the egg was seasoned well. Very impressed by the ramen here and it isn't overpriced compared to other places. Service is always fantastic!

We have experienced "Indian summer" for this Autumn season.  Oh, speaking of which, Chicago Cubs are the 2016 World Series champion.  Although there are some hot spots in Wrigleyville I would like to visit, hubby and I hanged out at "Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya" in Wicker Park instead.

My favorite is the garlic tonkotsu ramen - the others are just OK. The low-sodium option on the rameb still retains excellent flavor.
Also has alot of other nice food, like chicken/pork don (rice bowls) which are on happy hour menu. They have a great atmosphere and usually have special events and show miyazaki movies on some weeknights

This and wasabi are my ramen go-to places, way better than furious spoon across the street (more flavor and less salt)

Definitely a ramen place worth trying in Chicago. I would say it's one of the better ones too, next to Wasabi in Logan Square. They have a wide selection of ramens from chicken to pork broth and different ramen noodles.

Ordered the traditional Tonkatsu Shoyu which is a pork based broth. Everything that came in it was delicious, and while the broth was well-seasoned. I might opt for the low-sodium next time.

My partner ordered the yuzu shio which was a mixture of pork and chicken broth. The chicken broth toned the saltiness down for him. He thought it was delicious and definitely worth trying again. 

We both thought the egg that came with it could have been more savory. Also a bit too soft-boiled for our taste. 

Had a side of potato croquettes with nothing to complain about. 

It was worth coming to all in all. I liked that the ramen bowls weren't so big that I would hate myself after having finished. Under debate whether the size and quality made the price worth.

Service was good and waiters/waitresses were attentive.

Happy Hour specials (did not know that they had specials going on before 7pm), extremely helpful and knowledgeable staff to help us decide our order, and terrific ambiance.

I've had my fair share of ramen and I can confidently say this broth is probably the best I've had in Chicago. Most of our table ordered the Garlic Tonkatsu and I (had to be different so) opted for the Spicy. Both were exceptional--between the rich broth, authentic noodles, soft boiled eggs and veggies we were in ramen heaven! The pork was not my favorite as it was a bit tough but there are plenty of add-on options so I may swap out for another protein next time.

We also had an order of the (5) wings as an app. They were flavorful although it was a smaller than expected portion. 

They have a wide variety of sake/soju drinks served straight or in a mixed drink. I ordered the Mega Kuwaii which was so refreshing and dangerously smooth going down! I can't wait to try their other concoctions.

Our total for 4 people was about $75 for lunch and worth every cent.

I love ramen, and I always look forward to trying a new ramen place, especially when I'm visiting another city. I know that Chicago has a diverse array of places to eat, many great food choices. I dropped by here last night and initial impressions were good - I loved the vibrancy, the ambiance, and the overall feel. We didn't have to wait long to get our table of 2, considering it was very active for a Sunday night. We were seated with almost no wait. I started to pick through the menu to get a sense of the available offerings and I notice that I'm handcuffed when it comes to my ramen options - most of the ramen options have a pork-based broth. When our waiter arrived, a lovely gentleman I must say who was very professional and helpful, I inquired about the possibility of substituting the broth, but unfortunately it wasn't an option. My friend chose the veggie ramen while I settled on the only other viable option - the chicken rich ramen. For our appetizer we ordered the potato croquettes. They were very nice, seasoned beautifully, soft interior, crunchy exterior, visually appetizing and delicious.

The ramen was good, but it wasn't spectacular. The chicken was tough (overcooked perhaps) and it was large chunks that I had to break down manually, required more chewing than necessary. The broth was nice, and the noodles were fine. The egg.... it wasn't sliced in half or anything. Am I supposed to slice it using my chopsticks? Do I eat it whole? I didn't understand why I had a whole egg just plopped in my bowl of ramen? I've never experienced that with other ramen places, so it definitely threw me off.

Overall, it was worth trying. It's not mediocre, but it's not spectacular either. Unfortunately there weren't enough ramen options for me

Came into town to visit some old friends and they introduced us to Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya. The ambiance is nice and clean with plenty of tables and sushi bar sitting. We came on a Saturday evening during happy hour and enjoyed their $1 beer/person. Since I don't drink, husband got to enjoy my beer as well. They also have a few appetizers on the the happy hour menu. We got the Chicken Karaage aka fried chicken nuggets Japanese style. The chicken was tender, juicy and hot and tasted great with spicy mayo. 

I thought the ramen was so-so. I got the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen (Low Sodium), but found that I probably should've gotten traditional soup. The pork was rather tough and flavorless. Noodle was not as chewy as I had expected. Husband got the Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen (Low Sodium) with extra noodle, again, he probably should've ordered traditional soup too. I tried his soup and it was way too garlicky for me. 

At the end of the meal, I was still hungry, so we ordered the Chicken Wings since I saw it on the happy hour menu. Our waiter was nice enough to give it to us at the HH price even though it was 10 mins after HH. The Chicken wings were pretty satisfying, but I am super bias because I love chicken wings! They came out pipping hot, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Delicious!!

It seems to me that this restaurant really wants to expand their social media presence, so if you like them on Facebook, you can get a free edamame. Who doesn't like getting free stuff?
We also saw a sign on their door that says like them on Facebook for free green tea ice cream, unfortunately, we were too full for ice cream. Next time! 

Overall, the ramen was nothing spectacular in my book. Service was good though, our waiter was good about explaining all the options on the menu and was patient with the baby at our table. He gave the baby a plastic bowl, super cute! Most importantly, we learned that they have a joint in Carmel, IN and I'm sure we will pay them a visit when the ramen craving hits again and we aren't in Chicago!

I have heard great things about this restaurant but I can't say that I agree. I came here for ramen and small bites with friends. After receiving the pork bun which was basically all fat I lost my appetite. We only saw our waiter once when he first took our order. We had a different person drop off our food and give us our check. I thought it was odd that our server never came and checked on us.

Came here cause i originally heard of the Ramen bowl challenge. But i didn't see anything that mentions it in the menu at all. Also reading reviews seems like i wouldn't of gotten it anyway since i went there during dinner time. Moving along the interior seemed very nice of a location really spacious and looking fancy. The servers were of typical service very nice and warming. Now on to the food, what i really enjoyed was the takoyaki seem like i would expect from it and was so delicious. I got their ramen that seem to be there most popular since it was only a limited amount (or so it says on the menu). Mm didn't really tasted anything special from other ramen places I've been to and presentation was eh didn't have the flare of other ramen places. looks like they just threw it together. 

Overall really hyped of a ramen place, but if you do like ramen doesn't hurt to give it a try.

I have been wanting authentic Japanese ramen for a long time and somewhat mad I did not try this place sooner! I will definitely be back again soon!

I've had my fair share of ramen and I can confidently say this broth is probably the best I've had in Chicago. Most of our table ordered the Garlic Tonkatsu and I (had to be different so) opted for the Spicy. Both were exceptional--between the rich broth, authentic noodles, soft boiled eggs and veggies we were in ramen heaven! The pork was not my favorite as it was a bit tough but there are plenty of add-on options so I may swap out for another protein next time.

We also had an order of the (5) wings as an app. They were flavorful although it was a smaller than expected portion. 

They have a wide variety of sake/soju drinks served straight or in a mixed drink. I ordered the Mega Kuwaii which was so refreshing and dangerously smooth going down! I can't wait to try their other concoctions.

Our total for 4 people was about $75 for lunch and worth every cent.

I love ramen, and I always look forward to trying a new ramen place, especially when I'm visiting another city. I know that Chicago has a diverse array of places to eat, many great food choices. I dropped by here last night and initial impressions were good - I loved the vibrancy, the ambiance, and the overall feel. We didn't have to wait long to get our table of 2, considering it was very active for a Sunday night. We were seated with almost no wait. I started to pick through the menu to get a sense of the available offerings and I notice that I'm handcuffed when it comes to my ramen options - most of the ramen options have a pork-based broth. When our waiter arrived, a lovely gentleman I must say who was very professional and helpful, I inquired about the possibility of substituting the broth, but unfortunately it wasn't an option. My friend chose the veggie ramen while I settled on the only other viable option - the chicken rich ramen. For our appetizer we ordered the potato croquettes. They were very nice, seasoned beautifully, soft interior, crunchy exterior, visually appetizing and delicious.

The ramen was good, but it wasn't spectacular. The chicken was tough (overcooked perhaps) and it was large chunks that I had to break down manually, required more chewing than necessary. The broth was nice, and the noodles were fine. The egg.... it wasn't sliced in half or anything. Am I supposed to slice it using my chopsticks? Do I eat it whole? I didn't understand why I had a whole egg just plopped in my bowl of ramen? I've never experienced that with other ramen places, so it definitely threw me off.

Overall, it was worth trying. It's not mediocre, but it's not spectacular either. Unfortunately there weren't enough ramen options for me

Came into town to visit some old friends and they introduced us to Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya. The ambiance is nice and clean with plenty of tables and sushi bar sitting. We came on a Saturday evening during happy hour and enjoyed their $1 beer/person. Since I don't drink, husband got to enjoy my beer as well. They also have a few appetizers on the the happy hour menu. We got the Chicken Karaage aka fried chicken nuggets Japanese style. The chicken was tender, juicy and hot and tasted great with spicy mayo. 

I thought the ramen was so-so. I got the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen (Low Sodium), but found that I probably should've gotten traditional soup. The pork was rather tough and flavorless. Noodle was not as chewy as I had expected. Husband got the Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen (Low Sodium) with extra noodle, again, he probably should've ordered traditional soup too. I tried his soup and it was way too garlicky for me. 

At the end of the meal, I was still hungry, so we ordered the Chicken Wings since I saw it on the happy hour menu. Our waiter was nice enough to give it to us at the HH price even though it was 10 mins after HH. The Chicken wings were pretty satisfying, but I am super bias because I love chicken wings! They came out pipping hot, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Delicious!!

It seems to me that this restaurant really wants to expand their social media presence, so if you like them on Facebook, you can get a free edamame. Who doesn't like getting free stuff?
We also saw a sign on their door that says like them on Facebook for free green tea ice cream, unfortunately, we were too full for ice cream. Next time! 

Overall, the ramen was nothing spectacular in my book. Service was good though, our waiter was good about explaining all the options on the menu and was patient with the baby at our table. He gave the baby a plastic bowl, super cute! Most importantly, we learned that they have a joint in Carmel, IN and I'm sure we will pay them a visit when the ramen craving hits again and we aren't in Chicago!

Ahhh Kizuki is my favorite casual Japanese place in town!! I love it for so many reasons. Happy hour prices are like steal. It also has a variety of appetizers and sake drinks. And it has Chinese menu which makes my ordering 10x times easier... lol. I used to come here with some friends and we ordered every single appetizer on the menu. Great great experience every time!

I have heard great things about this restaurant but I can't say that I agree. I came here for ramen and small bites with friends. After receiving the pork bun which was basically all fat I lost my appetite. We only saw our waiter once when he first took our order. We had a different person drop off our food and give us our check. I thought it was odd that our server never came and checked on us.

Came here cause i originally heard of the Ramen bowl challenge. But i didn't see anything that mentions it in the menu at all. Also reading reviews seems like i wouldn't of gotten it anyway since i went there during dinner time. Moving along the interior seemed very nice of a location really spacious and looking fancy. The servers were of typical service very nice and warming. Now on to the food, what i really enjoyed was the takoyaki seem like i would expect from it and was so delicious. I got their ramen that seem to be there most popular since it was only a limited amount (or so it says on the menu). Mm didn't really tasted anything special from other ramen places I've been to and presentation was eh didn't have the flare of other ramen places. looks like they just threw it together. 

Overall really hyped of a ramen place, but if you do like ramen doesn't hurt to give it a try.

When this spot opened up right next to Umami in Wicker park, I was excited to have yet another ramen option around town. I didn't realize at first that it was part of a ramen chain that I've been to in Seattle. They must've changed their name from Kukai to Kizuki. 

Ambiance: A lot of the ramen places around Chicago seem to go for the minimalist, dark and divey type feel. But the inside of Kizuki was very clean and new, and gave off that chain restaurant type vibe. The seats were also really comfortable, so soft that they felt like I was sitting on a couch. It was pretty packed and lively when we went, which is what I lover about an izakaya type restaurant. 

Food:

Chicken wings - They didn't really have a heavy rub or were coated in sauce but still had a nice flavor. Good strong garlic taste with just the slightest glaze of sweetness to it. Not bad.

Shrimp cutlet - This reminded me of a dish called shrimp toast that I've had at other places. Basically shrimp tossed with a breading mix and then deep fried. I thought it was a little on the greasy side and they skimped a little on the amount of shrimp in there. 

Chicken Karaage - The karaage was delicious. It had pretty much everything I look for: crunchy breading, juicy meat, and a solid spicy mayo dipping sauce. The quintessential appetizer at any izakaya. 

Garlic tonkotsu Ramen

Broth - The broth was great, pretty much just as good as I remembered from the one I tasted in Seattle, and they actually gave a lot more of it here too. The fact that even have a low sodium option tells you how salty the regular version is...and I loved it. The broth was super salty, and packed one of the strongest garlic punches I've had in a bowl of ramen. I'm a garlic fiend and Kizuki earned a rare approval from me for proper garlic flavor intensity. The broth also had the slightest kick of spice to it that really made for a winning flavor combination. 

Noodles - The noodles were pretty standard, a little on the softer side and not quite at dente. Nothing really note-worthy about them, but they did the job. 

Toppings - I was pretty hungry so I added pork belly to the ramen too. After doing a direct comparison, there's such a clear difference between the regular chashu pork and the pork belly. The chashu pork was way thinner and had a pretty tough, almost leather-like texture. Taste-wise it did at least have some marinated flavor though. The pork belly on the other hand, was a super thick cut of pork with plenty of fat throughout. It was definitely tender but I thought it lacked a little in taste and texture. I wish it was seasoned a little more and was grilled or charred on the outside. The egg was great though. Unlike many other places around town, Kizuki gives a whole egg still in tact and achieves a perfect runny yolk. It was beautiful. As for the other toppings, they also had a mix of bamboo shoots, green onion, and nori. 

Overall, I place Kizuki in a class of ramen joints that aren't insanely popular but still serve up solid bowls of ramen. I'd never worry about thinking ahead and going at the right time to avoid a wait like I have to for high five or wasabi. It's a good, reliable option whenever you get the crave.

The ramen here is good, love that they have a low sodium option.

In my opinion the pork don (pork over rice) is the best to get here, unique and delicious. 

I also tried two of its onigiri but they weren't that good, either of them. Way too much rice not enough flavor

The best authentic ramen you can get in Chicago. I suggest starting with the takoyaki and then doing the spicy ramen. If you're really hungry, make sure you order additional noodles half way though you meal.

Honestly, I'm not a ramen person but I really enjoyed the ramen here. I've only been to a couple of ramen places in Chicago but they were either forgettable or as I've mentioned, I'm not a ramen person so I'm not the foodie expert on this food.

Parking: paid street parking is available. It was a weekday so it wasn't hard to find parking.

Ambience/Space: the space is spacious and it was crowded for a weekday around 1PM. However, my dad and I had no problem getting a table and didn't have to wait. The server was friendly and explained the menu and gave us her recommendations since it was our first time there. She was also nice enough to notify us that they ran out of the chicken kaarage as an appetizer but that was one of her recommendations for next time if we do dine again.

Menu: based on the waitress' recommendation, I ordered the Garlic Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen with pork belly. The sauce was delicious and I loved the garlic flavor. The pork belly was tender and melt in your mouth. I wish the egg was more yolky but it was good as well. If you don't like ramen, you can also order the rice dishes like chicken, pork, or tempura with rice.

Verdict: they claim to be the #1 Ramen place in Chicago and my dad and I believe it. For someone who isn't a ramen person, this place was memorable and I loved the garlic shoyu ramen. I'll come back next time to satisfy my ramen cravings.

I placed an order for spicy ramen with chicken substitute instead of pork and ordered it extra spicy because I'm brown and that's how we eat our food, which is extra hot and spicy. Took me about ten minutes to get the food and overall I thought the broth of the soup tasted very good along with the chicken and spices. I will definitely be back and will recommend this ramen spot to my friends.

I enjoy the ramen so much. I love the half boiled egg, it is delicious! Though I have nothing to compare it to really. Though last time I went, I'm assuming it was because it was later on the night?, they ran out of the egg. I was so sad and I'm from out of town so it was a bummer. The staff is super friendly. Some of the appetizers I did not enjoy, which is why it's not a full five. Kind of a hit or miss.

Finally found a great ramen place that won't break the bank, yay! 

Ambience:
Looks really fancy upon walking in and that you'd be paying a lot more than what the menu reflects. It was pretty quiet when we came in since it was only 5 pm but I'd expect it to be much busier later since it has a great location on Milwaukee. 

Service:
Friendly waiter who promptly seated us and took orders quickly without rushing us though. Came with 2 friends who didn't know how to use chopsticks so she was very attentive to our needs when we asked for forks. 

Food:
I got the shio ramen pictured below (just the normal, not the Yuzu). LOVE the greens they give you (also give you a fair amount of bamboo) I'm a big ramen eater and most places I've been to don't give you veggies without paying extra. Noodles were just right. If you order extra noodle, you can choose different shapes (thin, normal, or thick) but otherwise the original bowl is there standard noodle. Broth was delicious - I had debated getting the shoyu but glad I stuck with the shio. It was the perfect amount of flavor.  A lot of ramen places overdo the salt so great job on keeping the flavor without making my blood pressure skyrocket! 

Price:
My shio ramen was just $9 which is great if you compare to the other places in the city which range between $12-15. 

Definitely my new go-to ramen place! Taste and price is superior to other places I've been and a great location to top it off. I love wicker park so now I have even more reason to make a visit to this area!

Feeling tired from the gray skies and rain, three of us headed to Kizuki to warm up. We started with edamame, karaage, and takoyaki. Karaage was perfectly fried with a great crunch. The octopus in the takoyaki still had its flavor, super savory. I had the tonkotsu ramen. My friends had the spicy ramen and the chicken shoyu ramen. The broth of all of our noodles was on amazing. However, my ramen noodles were terrible. My ramen noodles stuck with each other, very sticky texture. Not entirely sure what happened here. I had better noodles here before, I guess it was a stroke a bad luck.

Before going back to Canada, my husband and I wanted to have a good last meal. We were at Mojo spa and they recommended this place and another place, but this place won us over because they said it's better for a "date night". Even at 11pm, this place was packed. We were seated right away and the service was very attentive.

We ordered agedashi tofu (meh, got soggy by the time it came to us), takoyaki (good, but we've had better), and then the ramen. We had the tonkotsu with garlic. It was OK - the toppings were so-so, the taste of the broth was above average... hm, yeah. 

There's nothing wrong with the place. The rating is because it hasn't wowed me like other places have. Would we go again if we were in Chicago? Probably not. Glad we tried it, but there's so many other places in town.

This review is for the Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. The broth was creamy and flavorful, containing the right amount of garlic, without it being overwhelming. The egg was cooked so that the yolk was perfectly runny - I do wish that it came already sliced in half. The slice of pork is lean and not fatty like pork belly, which would have been extra. At $13, this was a satisfying, tasty bowl of ramen!

I also enjoyed the Japanese decor, which was simple and created a lovely environment!

Came here with two friends on a Saturday night and waited around 30 minutes for a table, which wasn't terrible with their indoor waiting area. We ordered the onigiri to share (one order comes with two) and each got the garlic tonkotsu shoyu ramen. The only ramen I've had thus far before this was Jinya and this completely blew that out of the water. This ramen was SO GOOD - thick noodles, a good amount of meat, the perfect gooey egg and most importantly, the extra-rich shoyu-flavored pork broth with lots of garlic.

Ramen joint with good interior decor and a bar-like atmosphere: young and casual. Urban American. Owner is very involved in running the restaurant and him and all the staff are friendly and helpful. 
The tonkotsu ramen is definitely good, but it is not amazing. Contents are typical of what you'd get in a normal bowl- char siu, some vegetables, bamboo, etc.  The broth is a bit heavy, and too salty. That being said it beats a lot of other places like Slurping Turtle or Ramen-san. 
The fact that they have a 'low-sodium' option for all the ramen is a bit questionable. Should we not be ordering the regular? Its Chicago, not San Francisco or Portland. What's next? Gluten free?

Veggie ramen! Flavor is fine, the texture of the noodles was OK (a little bit chewy but not too bad). One downside to the vegetarian bowl is that the vegetables they put in it are kind of weird and don't go together very well. The mushrooms were delicious and greens were nice but the tomatoes gotta go.

Service is good, and the food came out quickly. The server made drink recommendations to save us money.

I second everything I've said in my previous review. Kizuki has delivered excellent ramen time and time again. The low-sodium option is perfect for me, but I have some salt-lovin' friends who think Their regular broth is the bees knees. BONUS! They have gluten-free noodles for all those GF peeps out there! Their soft-boiled egg has been perfectly cooked and runny Every. Single. Time.

Their chicken karaage is still one of my favorites and the shrimp shumai are a new favorite as well. Don't skip on the sake flights, and ask your server for a recommendation. Every time I'm there, they give me a well-informed suggestion or point me to someone who can!

I also appreciate places that will let you wander while you wait, and give you a call when your table is ready. With several bars right next door, it's great for a date night or night out with friends. Yay Wicker Park, yay Kizuki!

Food was great! Server or kitchen forgot my order. Person who dropped food didn't say anything. When we finally got hold of the server he had to reorder. So my friends waited 5 minutes to eat for nothing. Bill took along time to be collected for processing. Server was knowledgeable but didn't
really apologize  or offer a drink  or anything ( maybe then the manager would find out!) I would go back for the food  and give the service another shot. And will adjust my review if it improves.

Tried the signature Garlic Tonkatsu Ramen and it was very flavorful. The broth was good, the noodles were good, the pork was pretty decent, the egg was good. The meal was overall well-balanced and the proportions were right. Will definitely return to try more things.

This review is for the Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. The broth was creamy and flavorful, containing the right amount of garlic, without it being overwhelming. The egg was cooked so that the yolk was perfectly runny - I do wish that it came already sliced in half. The slice of pork is lean and not fatty like pork belly, which would have been extra. At $13, this was a satisfying, tasty bowl of ramen!

I also enjoyed the Japanese decor, which was simple and created a lovely environment!

So so good! The noodles were nice and bouncy and the soup was flavorful. We also ordered the soaked gummy bears- woah. We were so pleasantly surprised by them, and there were SO MANY gummy bears. The servers were amazing and accommodating. We had arrived a bit too early for the happy hour, but they were able to help us out.

Came here with two friends on a Saturday night and waited around 30 minutes for a table, which wasn't terrible with their indoor waiting area. We ordered the onigiri to share (one order comes with two) and each got the garlic tonkotsu shoyu ramen. The only ramen I've had thus far before this was Jinya and this completely blew that out of the water. This ramen was SO GOOD - thick noodles, a good amount of meat, the perfect gooey egg and most importantly, the extra-rich shoyu-flavored pork broth with lots of garlic.

Ramen joint with good interior decor and a bar-like atmosphere: young and casual. Urban American. Owner is very involved in running the restaurant and him and all the staff are friendly and helpful. 
The tonkotsu ramen is definitely good, but it is not amazing. Contents are typical of what you'd get in a normal bowl- char siu, some vegetables, bamboo, etc.  The broth is a bit heavy, and too salty. That being said it beats a lot of other places like Slurping Turtle or Ramen-san. 
The fact that they have a 'low-sodium' option for all the ramen is a bit questionable. Should we not be ordering the regular? Its Chicago, not San Francisco or Portland. What's next? Gluten free?

Veggie ramen! Flavor is fine, the texture of the noodles was OK (a little bit chewy but not too bad). One downside to the vegetarian bowl is that the vegetables they put in it are kind of weird and don't go together very well. The mushrooms were delicious and greens were nice but the tomatoes gotta go.

Service is good, and the food came out quickly. The server made drink recommendations to save us money.

Absolutely love the space at Kizuki...this is probably its biggest differentiator over the other ramen spots I have hit in Chicago (Oiistar, Wasabi, Ramen-san, Arami, Furious Spoon, Umai).

I didn't think the ramen broth/flavor was as strong as some of those previous choices, though.  We came in today to try the Spicy Ramen and the Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen; even with the three-pepper "hot" rating, the spicy was just a little spicy.  At Furious Spoon, they do the kind of spice I prefer.  The noodles in both bowls were excellent, but the fixins were only OK, including fairly average pork...tender, generally devoid of flavor both in the actual meat and the broth.

Dropped $40 for this meal (two bowls, plus a $5 draft, tax and tip).  A little pricey as a quick lunch, but when the temperatures drop, I'll always make a bowl of ramen work.

Service was very fast and friendly, and if you want to get in and out of here in 30 minutes for lunch, that's a cakewalk.

Looking forward to trying the items on the izakaya menu, but personally, I have a couple other spots I prefer for ramen.

The service was really nice and the ramen noodles itself and broth was nicely prepared, but I can't get over the portion size for the price. When compared to Oiistar or Furious Ramen, their ramen bowls are significantly smaller in portion. They don't include enough broth to slurp up with the noodles and toppings.

The broth is delicious, however. Extremely flavorful and rich in umami. The noodles have a nice semi-firm texture with a good bite to it. Love the toppings that come with it, especially the chasu and garlic and bamboo. But I'll stick to Oiistar or Furious when I'm craving ramen in the area because their portion size actually justify the price (plus they're also about $1-2 cheaper).

Came here with a few friends on a Saturday for dinner because they claimed this was the best ramen they've found in Chicago. So I came in with high expectations and a recommendation for what I should order. I got the garlic tonkatsu ramen (the low-sodium option) which, to their credit, was very good. The pork belly was very tender and by far the best part of that bowl besides the broth itself. Everything else was good, nothing mind-blowing but I'll definitely come back again!

I have a tendency to order ramen when I'm alone on a Friday or Saturday night, which is exactly what happened yesterday. I was browsing Uber Eats, ready to settle for Ramen San again (SIGH), when lo and behold! I found Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya. 

The menu itself seemed promising, so I didn't bother reading any reviews on Yelp as to not taint my experience (lol). I ordered the Chicken Shoyu Ramen with a Seasoned Half-Boiled egg. I was impressed when I saw that my food came with heating instructions. In the past, this was not the case. 

Chicken Shoyu Ramen: Everything I wanted. Perfect noodles, flavorful brother, crisp vegetables, and tender meat. Ugh yas. I'll never order from Ramen San again. 

Seasoned Half-Boiled Egg - PERFECT. The yolk dripped out seductively when I pierced the egg (see picture). I've had "Molten" Eggs before that were basically hard boiled...??

I typically drink all the broth because I LOVE salt...but I actually found that this broth was too salty for me without the noodles/veggies/meat, which has never really happened before.

Regardless, this is going to be my new go-to when I'm ordering ramen in. I look forward to eating in the actual shop itself soon too.

Went here for dinner on a Tuesday night, with no wait. The broth for the ramen is on point, and it got the seal of approval from my Japanese mother. I got the spicy ramen, which could have used more spiciness. They have three levels of spicy, I got the regular (medium), so if you like it hot, get the highest level of spiciness. We went at happy hour time, so we also got kara age (fried chicken), which was also very tasty; the chicken was marinated well.
During the summer, they offer free matcha ice cream after your meal on days that reach over 80 degrees. That was a refreshing and tasty treat at the end of our meal.

I've seen many posts about this place so went to try it out today.  

Order list:
Chicken skin (lightly sweet and lemony,  good with spicy oil) 
Seaweed salad (ordinary) 
Chicken karaage (amazing! Perfectly seasoned and tender)
Takoyaki (too bready) 
Spicy miso ramen (good) 
Spicy ramen (very good) 
Garlic tonkotsu shoyu ramen (good) 

We got in 10 minutes before happy hour ended so we were able to get pretty good deal. They had $1 beer with a ramen purchase! Food here is pretty solid, everything we ordered was decent to very good.

Number one ramen in Chicago?  I'm pretty surprised by that appellation. The noodles were good and I thoroughly enjoyed the ability to change it up and add a boiled egg which was delicious, but the soup is all wrong. In ramen, the key is subtly. A ramen chef in Japan spends all day making the soup. There are a million ingredients but in the end, it comes together as one and the customer drinks down the soup without realizing how complicated it was. That is the magic of ramen. Remarkable complexity that you have to really think about yo taste. 

At Kizuki, the soup hits you like a sledge hammer. All subtly is gone. The soup is so rich and spicy (in miso ramen) that you can't even drink it. The pork in the soup was too thin so it dried out. However, all of its oil bled into the soup making the soup to oily. 

Normally, the customer ears every drop of Ramen and every drop of soup. This is the way you tell the chef that it was delicious and you appreciated his efforts. At Kizuki, I ate the noodles, took one sip of the soup, and left it. I looked around. Everyone else was doing the same thing. 

This means that the soup, the most important part, was not edible. And everyone agreed with me. 

The Yuzu ramen was similar. Rather than a subtle hint of yuzu, it's completely over powering. Agedashi-dofu was good but bland. 

Not sure what is going on. Hate to generalize but maybe this is made for the Chicago palette?  Maybe chicagoans are not too subtle?  Maybe it responsive to the average Chicago ramen fan, not to me

COST:
$13 (Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen)
$6 (Gyoza Veggie)
$7 (Prawn Cutlet)
$4 (Agedashi Tofu)

I finally made it back here and with a group this time to try their food outside of the ramen. While the food was definitely good and tasty, I'd have to dock my review several stars down for horrible service. 

I came in with a group of three people total and requested split checks. One paid in cash and two of us had to split the rest of the check. The total was to be $15 each per person but for some reason, our server did the math wrong and just charged us $5 each. 

Being the honorable and honest man that I'd like to think I am, I told the server he split the checks wrong. I was then given an attitude and scoffed at that he did was he was told which was to take the cash and split the rest. I then had to tell him no, it's wrong because of his math and he actually charged us way less! He took the checks back and no apologies were given. 

I got up my seat to use the bathroom and instead of getting the expected $15 split checks, we got $20 split checks instead because he realized he had forgotten to charge us one thing! Unbelievable!!!

Now I'm not expecting to NOT pay for food we ordered and eat. However, give us some slack by actually being honest people. This is why we can't have nice things.

I've been on a quest to try out all the supposedly great ramen places in Chicago (so far, I would only return to Wasabi and Takeya), so naturally I had to come in for dinner when my friend and I first noticed Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya. 

The interior is beautifully lit, very spacious, and extremely clean. We came in around 6:30pm on a weekday and were immediately seated. I ordered the garlic tonkatsu shoyu ramen and my friend had the yuzu shio ramen, something she said she hasn't been able to find in the States very often (she's half-Japanese). We both went for the less-sodium option, which is something I really love about Kizuki, considering I've found most of the ramen I've tried to be too salty. Both ramen bowls were delicious - the garlic flavor was strong, and the citrus broth of the yuzu made it taste very light. Service was fast and friendly, and tea is complimentary. I'll definitely be sure to come back here again!

Let's make this quick & easy:

(1) Wasabi is still the best overall ramen place in Chicago
(2) Get the Spicy Ramen -- best in town, I think
(3) Spend that little extra to substitute Pork Belly for Pork Shoulder
(4) Yes, this place has multiple locations across the country, but you should still try it.

This ramen craze is out of control. There is three ramen joints in Wicker Park - Oiistar, Furious Spoon, and Kizuki. It's one thing to follow trends, but it's another to bring it to another level. With that said, thank you for finally opening and being a legit ramen joint! 

The first time I gave this place a shot was their second week of opening with my girlfriends on a Saturday night. Packed but worth the wait I promise! 

Our waitress was very timid yet attentive to our table. Answered our million questions, but was very patient and helpful. We started with the takoyaki. Yum! Good texture and consistency. We each ordered something different and it looked like everyone was quite happy with their choice. I got the Spicy Ramen (regular) with a side of corn (Tip: Free refills on the corn. Yes, FREE!) Not too heavy, yet so much flavor! Probably should have gotten it spicer, but I wanted to taste the broth and not be overwhelmed by the spice, so regular was just the right amount. We all left happy and full. 

A week later, after raving to my boyfriend about this place, I finally convinced him to check this place out. We went on a Friday night. Busy per usual. We were hungry, so we opt to sit by the bar. Better that way anyways because I got to see the kitchen and how they cooked all this goodness.

Before we got hangry, we went straight into ordering. He got the Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen w/ pork belly upgrade, and I got the Miso Ramen (spicy). The garlic ramen was awesome. You get some garlic taste but it wasn't overpowering. I let him in on the unlimited corn secret and we were in corn heaven! The broth to the garlic ramen had more depth whereas the miso was light and too salty, just the way I like it. The pork belly upgrade is definitely worth it. It is more smoky than the chashu. Get the pork belly over the chashu if you can. 

In one month, I had to stop myself from going every week. I was trying to find any and every excuse to keep going back. Overall, great food and good atmosphere. If you are into drinks, they have quite the selection, but of course it is about the ramen. With warmer weather coming, I am glad they offer Tsukemen (Dipping Ramen) because their selection looks good and it is a better alternative.

I really don't see what the hype about this place is all about. I can see the appeal of a ramen and Izakaya place in Wicker park can cause a lot of attention and I really did want to be hopeful. The interior and atmosphere was very fun and spacious. Definitely did give you a feel like you were in an actual izakaya. We ordered quite a lot of small dishes and were very pleased with those.

 Between the two of us, we shared the Karage, takoyaki, and the char siu buns. All of them were actually relatively tasty. Karage will always be my favorite and this place really didn't disappoint on these dishes. The karage was nicely battered and crispy without being dense and too oily. Takoyaki was nice and tender, with big bits of octopus in it. The char siu buns were good, I found it to be a little salty and the meant to be on the drier side. 

Now to the main supposedly star of the show, the ramen. I ordered the garlic tonkotsu ramen whilst my friend got the garlic shoyu ramen. The noodles were quite good, much better than those that you get at furious spoon or most ramen locations. That was the best thing about our ramen. Although rich in flavor, the broth was so salty. Like so salty that it was almost unbearable to eat, we literally found ourselves having to pour water into our bowls to dilute the saltiness. The meat in our bowls were also very dry and tough. It seemed like the meat was just sitting out, sliced and just thrown into our bowls. 

I will not be coming back for more ramen but may consider coming back for the other dishes. I'm still on the hunt for that perfect bowl of ramen in Chicago!!

Great food, but be aware if you are allergic to gluten. The yam noodles are cooked in the same pot as the non-gluten noodles. There were noodles that were not gluten free mixed in with my dish. Thankfully, I noticed them. The employees were happy to make me a new ramen bowl, but I don't know if I would risk it going back.

I like the fact this restaurants has other franchised restaurants Japan and Taiwan, where ramen comes from!  It is definitely a good sign.  

The chicken karrage is AMAZING and is a very good appetizer.  I had Yuzu Shio Ramen, and I highly recommend it.  it's very authentic,  tasty but not overpowering, and i like the citrusy soup.  The price is very reasonable and food is quality.  I will definitely come back.

He had spicy. I had tonkotsu. Spicy was the better choice and "regular" spice shouldn't scare anyone off. It's perfect for the person who says "I want to know it's there but not dominate". (He will go a level higher next time)

The eggs are whole. Cooked perfectly, but served chilled - so I had to keep circulating broth over the second one. Had I only had 1 that's info I never would have had. 

The noodles are decent. Not as chewy/springy as my favorite (Ramen Misoya) but this is a different place. 

The karaage app was good. 

I'd come back. We were here on a Monday afternoon (non-holiday) which is really the only time these 40-somethings can stand Wicker Park.

Such authentic and delicious ramen! Loved the chashu and Yuzu shio soup! And that lot of scallion went so well with the ramen! Takoyaki was also super delicious!

On an almost-summer night wandering around Wicker, we landed here. To be honest, the decor drew us in. Clean, modern, and obviously japanese.

Prices: looking at 10-13$ a bowl ramen with $1.50 topping add-ons.

Beers: $5-7ish. Not bad.

They do low-sodium options that seem to be a hit or miss, and the bowls in general are on the smaller side for ramen.

I order a Shio ramen + Asahi (they have it on draft), while my boyfriend ordered the tonkatsu ramen + a bottled beer.

Their beer glasses are all chilled, which is a small detail that makes a hell of a difference.

As for the ramen itself - i'm torn. My boyfriend's tonkatsu was so good but my shio (low sodium) kind of tasted like noodles in hot tap water. I get that it's low sodium but there was little depth.

I was also confused by the pictures and description mismatches. The pictures on the menu include toppings but it's unclear whether the toppings are included in the price (they are).

My biggest beef though was that all the topping seemed so pre-made and, cold. My softboil egg, while cooked to perfection was served with a cold interior. kind of puts a damper in an otherwise great meal.

Been meaning to try this place out since it opened earlier this year. Last weekend I finally got the chance to stop by and it was worth the wait. The interior was incredibly cozy despite coming in during their dinner rush. I got to sit at the bar and was greeted by the wonderful servers who helped out pick out the perfect ramen dish. 

Everything looked so good and smelled so good. Even the beer selection was unique. They also have happy hour everyday with some great sake and plum wine deals. 

Who knew ramen and beer go so good together though?!

This is as good as it gets. Pretty much on the same level as Wasabi. And Wasabi's like the best ramen in town. So now there's 2 great ramen places in town! I came around 6:30 on a Friday with some friends. It was full, but not packed or overcrowded. We were seated right away. Also very nice interior decor! 

The ramen selection is amazing! There's like 10 different ramen to choose from. They also have a low sodium option for some of the ramen. I got the garlic tonkotsu shoyu ramen with low sodium, and it was so good! The egg was on point - texture was perfect, soft but not runny. You also get a whole egg :D Noodles also on point - nice and chewy. You can add toppings for an extra charge too. 

Service was fast and friendlyWe got complimentary tea. What more can I ask for? I'll be coming back soon to try the rest of the ramen :D

We ordered the octopus balls for appetizer, which comes in 6, 3 of them were icy inside. When we complained to the waiter, he said that was impossible, because they were fried...we normally don't complain much about food, but it was ridiculous that he even refused to touch the inside of the balls. We didn't want to make a huge scene, we just sucked up to it. The ramen was pretty good, but I thought the broth was a bit salty, I felt like wanting to drink lots of water afterwards. We haven't tried every ramen shop in the city, but just compare to Wasabi, Wasabi is definitely better.

This ramen craze is out of control. There is three ramen joints in Wicker Park - Oiistar, Furious Spoon, and Kizuki. It's one thing to follow trends, but it's another to bring it to another level. With that said, thank you for finally opening and being a legit ramen joint! 

The first time I gave this place a shot was their second week of opening with my girlfriends on a Saturday night. Packed but worth the wait I promise! 

Our waitress was very timid yet attentive to our table. Answered our million questions, but was very patient and helpful. We started with the takoyaki. Yum! Good texture and consistency. We each ordered something different and it looked like everyone was quite happy with their choice. I got the Spicy Ramen (regular) with a side of corn (Tip: Free refills on the corn. Yes, FREE!) Not too heavy, yet so much flavor! Probably should have gotten it spicer, but I wanted to taste the broth and not be overwhelmed by the spice, so regular was just the right amount. We all left happy and full. 

A week later, after raving to my boyfriend about this place, I finally convinced him to check this place out. We went on a Friday night. Busy per usual. We were hungry, so we opt to sit by the bar. Better that way anyways because I got to see the kitchen and how they cooked all this goodness.

Before we got hangry, we went straight into ordering. He got the Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen w/ pork belly upgrade, and I got the Miso Ramen (spicy). The garlic ramen was awesome. You get some garlic taste but it wasn't overpowering. I let him in on the unlimited corn secret and we were in corn heaven! The broth to the garlic ramen had more depth whereas the miso was light and too salty, just the way I like it. The pork belly upgrade is definitely worth it. It is more smoky than the chashu. Get the pork belly over the chashu if you can. 

In one month, I had to stop myself from going every week. I was trying to find any and every excuse to keep going back. Overall, great food and good atmosphere. If you are into drinks, they have quite the selection, but of course it is about the ramen. With warmer weather coming, I am glad they offer Tsukemen (Dipping Ramen) because their selection looks good and it is a better alternative.

I really don't see what the hype about this place is all about. I can see the appeal of a ramen and Izakaya place in Wicker park can cause a lot of attention and I really did want to be hopeful. The interior and atmosphere was very fun and spacious. Definitely did give you a feel like you were in an actual izakaya. We ordered quite a lot of small dishes and were very pleased with those.

 Between the two of us, we shared the Karage, takoyaki, and the char siu buns. All of them were actually relatively tasty. Karage will always be my favorite and this place really didn't disappoint on these dishes. The karage was nicely battered and crispy without being dense and too oily. Takoyaki was nice and tender, with big bits of octopus in it. The char siu buns were good, I found it to be a little salty and the meant to be on the drier side. 

Now to the main supposedly star of the show, the ramen. I ordered the garlic tonkotsu ramen whilst my friend got the garlic shoyu ramen. The noodles were quite good, much better than those that you get at furious spoon or most ramen locations. That was the best thing about our ramen. Although rich in flavor, the broth was so salty. Like so salty that it was almost unbearable to eat, we literally found ourselves having to pour water into our bowls to dilute the saltiness. The meat in our bowls were also very dry and tough. It seemed like the meat was just sitting out, sliced and just thrown into our bowls. 

I will not be coming back for more ramen but may consider coming back for the other dishes. I'm still on the hunt for that perfect bowl of ramen in Chicago!!

Great food, but be aware if you are allergic to gluten. The yam noodles are cooked in the same pot as the non-gluten noodles. There were noodles that were not gluten free mixed in with my dish. Thankfully, I noticed them. The employees were happy to make me a new ramen bowl, but I don't know if I would risk it going back.

Had the garlic tonkotsu ramen and the chicken karaage, and both were pretty good!

Ramen - Flavorful and rich broth, really good noodles, perfect egg, and very, very enjoyable char-su! I had a bite of my brother's pork belly and it was wonderfully fatty. Definitely one of the better ramen bowls I've had in the city.

Chicken karaage - Big chunks of chicken thighs, nice breading, left me wanting more.

Super solid place with nice service and great atmosphere. Check it out!

Notes:
- when you enter or leave the place they yell...in a nice way in Japanese 
- they don't take reservations
- they are not byob
- the seats in front of the entrance can get drafty and cold

The good:
- they actually have low sodium options. 
- the Tako yaki appetizer was a bit doughy but not overly drenched in sweet sauce
- noodles are not too thin in the garlic tonkatsu bowl and they give you a whole soft boiled egg :)

The meh:
- the pork slices in each ramen bowl wasn't that enticing
- they don't have hot sake :(
- the bamboo in the bowl gives a very odd flavor that I didn't like....maybe it was cuz it had canned bamboo.

Overall its a good spot to grab decent food. Their ramen doesnt shine for me but still a place to gather friends.

I enjoyed my experience here. I'm still on the hunt to find Los Angeles-good ramen, but in a pinch, I'd come here again. It didn't blow me away. It was just good. The service was a bit slow, but I think they were behind on prep. It's pricey, so I definitely won't be a regular, but, again, in a pinch, when I'm in this hood, I might pop in.

Kizuki has quickly become one of my favorite ramen spots in the city. They have a wide array of different kinds of ramen/broth flavors so you're bound to find something that you enjoy. They have have a huge list of appetizers as well, I've yet to try one that I haven't enjoyed.

I love getting the pork bun because the spicy mayo that comes with is delicious. I also always get the Chicken Shio ramen and add eggs. They marinate their eggs in soy I believe (perhaps something else) but either way it's to die for.

After about coming here close to 10 times now I can't say I've had a negative experience or a poor quality meal. They're always consistent which is an important feature to have in my opinion.

My new go-to ramen place at work. The broth was on point with a fair amount of meat. The staff were really friendly and the menu was extremely easy to navigate. Great for friends or small groups.

The Izakaya aspect of this restaurant was what initially piqued my interest. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the real star of the show here is the ramen.

Who would have thought that after going on my quest for the most authentic ramen in Chicago that I would accidentally stumble upon it while trying to get my takoyaki fix!  I ordered the garlic tonkotsu ramen and the broth was rich and flavorful while the noodles were perfectly chewy.  The garlic flavor was very subtle, but did just enough to enhance the taste.  The only small gripe I have with the ramen is the portion size.

Now onto the Izakaya dishes.  These are the reason this place did not get a 5-star review from me.  Our group ordered the pork buns, tuna onigiri, chicken karaage, and the takoyaki to share.  Where the ramen was full of flavor, the Izakaya dishes were quite the opposite.  The pork belly within the buns were nice and tender, but had no taste to it.  The onigiris were tasty, but the rice to filling ratio was completely off.  The chicken karaage tasted like fried chicken that someone forgot to season.  Finally, the takoyaki were just slightly warmer than lukewarm when they arrived and were missing just a little *something* that I couldn't quite put my finger on.

I ate here back in March when it first opened so a lot may have changed since. I would definitely come back for the ramen and maybe a chance at redemption for the small plates.

The food: 2/5. We had some kind of cold spinach app, octopus karaage and tonkotsu ramen with extra pork belly. I have to say, that was the saddest pork belly I've seen in my life. First of all, the meat serving is very small and the extra pork belly is only one piece. A good pork belly is supposed to melt in your mouth, but the one I had at Kizuki was very tough and flavorless. The broth was a little smokey, which I liked, but overall ok. It didn't have the silky texture or complexity to it. The apps were ok, nothing stood out. 

Overall, disappointing ramen. Well, I've been to Japan too and suggesting this ramen is on par with ramen there is ludicrous.

My 15 month old daughter would say "yum yum, nom nom" and proceed to slurp the noodles and soup from the bowl, which is basically what Hubby and I did when we went for an early dinner this weekend.  I knew this place was legit when Hubby mentioned trying the location in Bellevue, WA, which he said was smaller, always packed, and always busy.  This location has only been open for less than a year and wasn't too busy for an early Saturday evening.  Another good sign of authenticity, lots of Asians were there when we were. 

The spot is pretty spacious and well-lit from the huge floor to ceiling front windows that were open to let in fresh air and catch the breeze, which is nice so it's not hot, sweaty, and dark like other ramen places.  They had high chairs for kids and cute plastic kiddie bowls so they can have some ramen too.  Everyone was super friendly and accommodating.

We started with the popular Chicken Karaage, which were flavorful crispy chicken nuggets with a side of yellow radishes and spicy mayo.  The pieces were a good size, and definitely more than the amount of dipping sauce provided (only downside).  We also ordered the tuna mayo Onigiri, which came with 2 rice balls that were hefty in size.  They were tasty, but packed a lot of rice!  We also ordered one Japanese Pork Bun, which was a good size for baby girl.

For ramen, Hubby had the Yuzo Shio Ramen...there was a nice touch of citrus that balanced the savory umami broth without overpowering it...one of the best broths I've tasted!  I had the Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen, which was also very flavorful.  I really liked how they a low sodium option for each type of ramen, and it was perfect because you can really taste the broth without excessive salt.  You are also able to sub the ramen toppings if you like, for example, I hate bamboo (I'm not a panda like my Hubby who eats that stuff up) so I subbed corn instead.  I'm also not a fan of the soft-boiled egg, so had my hardboiled instead. You can also upgrade the meat to pork belly, but I chose not to this time around, and the regular pork hit the spot.  The food came out pretty fast, with the smaller dishes first followed by the ramen.  It was nice to sit in a corner booth so we had a big table to spread out.

I'd say this is probably my new favorite ramen spot in Chicago so far, and so happy it's fairly close to home.

Nice little sushi spot! We enjoyed the complimentary cuke salad and orange sections. The edamame was really fresh, as was the white tiger special roll. Check out the lunch special 2 roll menu choice for a good deal.

Service was friendly and prompt, and it's easy to get here from the train.

I was intrigued by the photos of the fresh looking sashimi and sushi so I decided to give it a try. 

:: service & experience::
Service was extremely attentive. The Cubs were playing that night so I shamelessly asked them to turn on the TV. Turns out the TV was there for decoration only haha. Other than that, the restaurant felt extremely intimate since they were playing some romantic love songs. Can be a bit awkward if you come here with a friend.

:: food ::
Even though uni is not in season right now, they have it. Our waitress told me that they get them in fresh everyday. It was good (too chilled/cold) and certainly hit the spot, but not sure if it was worth $10 for two pieces. The sweet shrimp was fine, although I'm not sure why they put some sauce on the fried shrimp heads. The sashimi platter was a decent value, with the yellowtail being the best one. A lot of their menu items have escolar, which I try to avoid. So if that's not your thing either, keep that in mind.

For the price, it was actually pretty good. But if I want quality, I'd rather spend a little bit more and get something more fresh. Or if I am just craving that irresistible combination of vinegar, rice, and fish, I'd rather go somewhere cheaper. Kai Sushi is in the awkward mid-range position that does neither exceptionally well.

It's shocking that a place like this have such high review. Either the other reviews are done by fake accounts or chicago just really have no idea what is a decent sushi place. I would give this negative stars if I could. 

The sashimi was NOT fresh, especially the SWEET SHRIMP. We had to eat RAW SHRIMP HEAD, yes you heard me. Kai Sushi, everything you put on the plate should be eatable, don't give me fried shrimp head with the sweet shrimp sashimi if you don't cook it through!!

If this isn't bad enough, the manager's reaction is asking if we want more shrimp head... I mean seriously??? Like 2 raw shrimp head with nasty organs inside is not bad enough, and you are offering us more shrimp head?? Oh and she said maybe give us ice cream for free.

Lady, you just served us RAW seafood that could cause diarrheal and easily upset our stomach. 

The dry tuna, salty mackerel are not even worth mentioning comparing to this nasty shrimp head. We left the store extremely angry, and now 4 out of 6 of us are having upset stomach.

Let's also not forget we ordered fresh wasabi for $3, and it was never served. 

Terrible, just terrible experience.

Conveniently located in the south loop, the location is small but cozy.

Service is fast. The cucumber appetizer that they give everyone is yummy!

I ordered the chirashi bowl ($21) which comes with a bowel of miso soup and 10 slices of sashimi and 2 eggs. The fish is very fresh and delicious but I was expecting more! Pricey but good.

They've got some pretty good lunch specials here it seems like, will be back then!

I thought this place was ok fish and mediocre service.

I went at an odd hour around 3:30PM so there was only one other table there. A ton of staff working though and it was impossible to get their attention to order...

I ordered the squid salad and tried the cucumber salad / miso they give you with the chirashi bowl. Most of the stuff tasted like Korean cuisine, was a bit pickled and not usually what you'd get. Squid salad didn't taste too fresh and didn't care to finish it. When I got my chirashi bowl I thought the fish to rice ratio was off (wasn't much rice). The rice wasn't the usual sweet vinegar taste. It was very salty and I had to drink a lot of water to down the taste which was a bummer.

I think I would try other places before considering coming back.

I've been here a few times and the food has always been good. I really want to give this place five stars, but today when I placed an order for pick up, I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. 30 minutes later and still no food. I'm still sitting here while I write this. The restaurant isn't full. Lots of empty tables. Why am I waiting for my food?

TLDR: the rolls here are absolutely delicious (5 stars) BUT they charged me more than what I signed for and will not respond to my follow-ups which is why I give it 2 stars. Please doublecheck your receipts and credit card statement to see if it matches up. 

When going through my credit card statement a couple weeks after eating here, I noticed they charged me $50 flat which is weird because my food + tax + tip was $41.91 (I have receipt evidence). I'm pretty sure restaurants are not allowed to round up? I contacted them multiple times but was ignored. I'm not upset about being charged 9 cents more but moreso upset at the principle of them charging more than what I signed for. If they rounded up for other customers, imagine how much extra money they're making. 

This place is right next to my apartment so I finally decided to give it a try after seeing the great reviews on Yelp. I came here with a group of 4 and we sat outside which was perfect for the breezy cool summer night. It's BYOB so we brought beer from our apartment upstairs. My boyfriend and I ordered 3 rolls to share - Flaming VIP, Volcano & Super Crunchy. Holy moly..everything was delicious and we devoured everything! The only downside is that it's a bit pricey since the special rolls are $12.95-$13.95 per roll so it came out to be around $25 per person.

Great, tasty, no frills sushi place with a nice outdoor patio. 

The first time I went here I wasn't too impressed. Then I learned about the lunch special and realized the place is actually pretty great. The crunchy crab roll was great, the spicy salmon was just okay but the presentation was great, and the ocean roll was great (but that's not part of the lunch special). Also I've never been a fan of miso soup but their version of it is fantastic.  

The server was polite and attentive even though she was busy, and overall the bill was very reasonable for a sushi lunch.

Had a really good dinner :) the reviews have it. The fish is fresh, the service is great, the atmosphere is lively. The restaurant is small and intimate and the wait was fast.

The chirashi don is layered with two pieces of variety of fish. My favorite was the white tuna and the salmon. I had to eat the salmon last (the best for last) because it was packed with omega 3 fatty acids. The only thing I will say is the rice was a little sour/vinegary. 

The other two rolls we got was the ocean and flaming VIP. I'm not a super fan of smoked salmon on sushi but the flaming VIP had a slightly seared salmon draped on top with spicy crab . The sauce was sweet soy. The ocean also lived up to the hype. Crunchy shrimp tempura, avocado, tempura crumbs. 

Overall, it was good service, good portion, and complementary cucumber appetizer and fruit dessert completed the visit. Very good.

I appreciated and loved every little detail in this small restaurant. I dropped by for an early dinner and the place was pleasantly chill. The waitress was very kind and helpful - I was asking stupid questions like is Chirashi big enough and she did her best to come up with an answer. I ended up getting Chirashi + 2 pieces of salmon sushi. 

The food really hit my sushi craving. All the fish pieces were very tender (and fresh enough), and the portion was reasonably satisfying. I'd love to go back soon and try the rolls that others recommend.

I was walking home and I was cold and hungry so I placed 2 udon soups to go. They said to pick up the order in 20 minutes. It was ready when I walked in. I've never ate here before so the veggie udon soup hit the spot. The next day I ate the spicy beef curry udon and it tasted like my mom's curry soup. Will come back to try other things on the menu.

Even though we live 2 blocks away, we hadn't been back for a while. We decided to do a Monday night dinner at Kai and I was disheartened by how far they've fallen. 

First the place needs a good cleaning. Floors were dirty and cobwebs were visible in ceiling corners. The tiny menus had been reused so many times, mine was splattered with soy sauce. Second, the sushi isn't that great. The Chicago Fire roll was missing something. Tasted boring.  All the rest of the rolls were bland and mushy. The special Tuna Tartar was decent but would have worked better as a poke.  It also was mushy. I guess the only saving grace was the meal was relatively cheap but it's obvious you get what you pay for.

Personally I think sushi should be unique and flavorful. And unfortunately Kai is going for boring and mushy in a setting that needs to buy a Swiffer.

Ordered delivery from here and the food arrived fresh and on time.

Sashimi Platter (5/5): the slices of fish were large and fresh
Crab/ Scallop Roll (5/5): delicious, love the combination of flavors
Eel Nigiri (2 pieces)--fresh and great flavors.
Seaweed salad: good, but my complaint would be that the portion size is very small.

It was very nice that the restaurant gave me 2 spring rolls for free with a happy face written in mayo sauce--cute gesture!

I have always been curious about this place as my ex gf lived in the building that this place resides. I recall smelling the raw goodness almost every time I set foot in the building; not to mention the place always seemed packed. 

I decided recently it was time to finally check it out. I realized the place is BYOB as I noticed there wasn't a bar...I obviously stuck with water due to this fact. I ordered a couple of pieces of eel and it was very good. The spicy tuna was very good as well. There was another roll on special that we ordered that included orange chunks...was pretty meh. Outside seating available for all the summertime al fresco fans.

It was a quick stop on the way back to the suburbs and  evem though we found out it was byob a little too late, this place is still delicious!  We just stuck to the pieces rather than the rolls but even without their fancy sauces,  it was still delicious!

A pretty good sushi place. It's chill and quiet but everyone is friendly. 

We got the sashimi platter, ocean roll, rainbow roll, and the blue tuna special (or something like that). 

The sashimi platter and ocean roll are things that i definitely recommend. The fish is really fresh for the platter and the ocean roll is just a good roll in general. Definitely worth getting. 

The rainbow roll was alright. Nothing to go crazy over. It was a pretty basic roll that is more on the safe and simple side of the menu. 

Finally, definitely keep away from the blue tuna special thingy. On the original roll, it was supposed to have seared tuna, but since my friends and I don't particularly like it, we just got regular raw tuna. The roll's filling is crab meat and it did not go well with the tuna. It made everything really heavy and thick in texture. It definitely needed a sauce or just something sharp or crunchy to cut through the monotonous texture and flavor. 

Lowkey feel like this place is more on the bougie end of the scale. The prices aren't too crazy but are still up there. (I didn't want to be the fatass of the group so I didn't order more when I definitely could've eaten more) 

Give it a visit if you want fresh sushi and don't mind spending at least $30.

Service was great.

The sushi was beyond average but not close to great. We ordered the sashimi appetizer the fish was not very fresh. We also ordered 3 special rolls, there was too much rice. The rice made the whole roll taste sour because of the vinegar. If they could reduce the rice to just one layer, that would make everything just perfect.

One-time delivery review: 
This is a hidden gem! I don't find myself in South Loop often so it's nice that they deliver. The sushi was very fresh; we tried a variety of rolls including tuna, salmon, crab, and scallops. The shrimp tempura in the rolls was amazing and I wish I knew why...it was almost sweet or just super fresh, not sure...
It wasn't a perfect experience - the miso soup seemed a little processed/overly concentrated, and I didn't love the spicy stuff they put on my scallop sashimi, but overall: two thumbs the F up!

Mediocre sushi for a fine price, sure. 

What they DON'T tell you, is that they charge a $3 corkage fee... for a place that's BYOB. While not unlawful, definitely unethical. When I asked the manager for the logic behind it, he merely said, "this is the rule, you can go elsewhere if you'd like." And while I love a good 'ol fashion "my way or the highway," banter, letting me know about this corkage fee when I called and tried to make a reservation earlier in the day would have been nice.

Needless to say, I will continue to "go elsewhere" for sushi. You have lost my business, sir.

Such a fun little spot! My friends and I decided to have a girls night out here an it was so much fun. This was our first time trying a BYOB restaurant out and I can't wait to try it again! Not only was it a fun experience, but the sushi was quality too.  I had the salmon sashimi and that almost melted in my mouth. the texture wasn't the most fluffy, but the taste was just how I like it. They also had an assortment of rolls to try out. My good friend is allergic to fish (yeah yeah why go to a sushi place? because it delicious thats why lol) but there were a good amount of crab rolls and tempura rolls to try out too! I usually don't go for tempura rolls, but the tempura wasn't too overpowering in the sushi and I liked it quite a bit.  

The service was a little bit slow and I felt like our waitress was disappearing on us quite a bit, but I suspect thats due to the fact that it was a Friday night.  I didn't see this as much of an issue because I was in good company. They o offer outside seating

Overall a really fun place to try out. I can't wait to come back when Im back in town!

After a terrible experience at sushi sai a month or so ago, it came time again where I had a hankering for sushi on a week night after work meaning not energy, desire or time to travel too far north.

I picked like 3 places for my girlfriend to meet me at and since she forced me to choose I picked a location closest to me commuting home. Lucky for me it was a great choice!!!

I loved that this place is BYOB with no fee for parties w/less than 5 ppl. The sushi really is prepared with fresh ingredients! You can tell the fish is not days old. Because of this it doesn't come to your table right away, but it is worth the wait!!

I think it's a good place to come for a super casual dinner in a small group or catching up with a friend. This place isn't for frills, however the seating is quaint and the lighting is DIM. 

They are definitely reasonable for their price and I'll be back! Everything I had was yummy! 

1 star taken away because of the tight ass of seating & lightening that felt accidentally dim and not romantic like I'm assuming the goal is. 

I'll be back! I told all my co workers about this place, my boyfriend, and even my friends that live out of a state. Good causal sushi spot!

Stumbled upon this place by the amount of high reviews it has on yelp. To my disappointment the sashimi wasn't fresh. The texture was good, however the taste was off. The fish seemed to have a hint of sourness to it. It wasn't so bad that I would consider the fish bad, but it wasn't fresh. As for their rolls, they were okay. Either heavily sauced or had something like mango, avocado, or another potent fruit that would mask the fish. 
Their menus aren't Japanese like at all. It's very Americanized if anything.

The service was so-so. We came in during a rush, the host seemed to be frantic and the server  seemed rushed too.

We spent a beautiful afternoon celebrating my daughters 12th birthday here and the food was absolutely delicious.  We don't mind that it wasn't the most swanky place in Chicago as long as the food is superior and it was very good sushi.  The seaweed salad was fresh and we had several rolls (avocado & California) for our youngest along with special rolls like the Dragon, Super Crunchy, & Rainbow.  All were great.  We will be back next time we visit and hope to get their red bean mochi and green tea ice cream as well.  Service was friendly and the chefs appreciated our positive reviews as we parted.  Great sushi place!

I'm a fan!  Loved their service and the Sushil was amazing.  We ordered miso with edamame as usual... What really got my taste buds excited was their specialty spicy tuna. 

Staff was very friendly, and the ambiance was casual.  We loved the corner table right behind the structure pole, BYOB made our experience even more enjoyable without worrying about a hefty $$ bill.  Chef stays in touch with his guest by sending something very special; ours was ice-cream.  I think that's a very good quality of any chef who typically doesn't get to see their guest but yet makes a connection with small gestures.  

overall a must try - little gem of a place!

Kai is our go-to place for sushi whether it's dining in or delivery. We recently had the chance to dine in again, and the food, of course, is delicious--we usually order tempura, tuna tataki, flaming VIP, caterpillar, volcano and ocean roll. Their cucumber salad is refreshing, and their green tea ice cream is a must!

I would give ten stars for the service, if I could, as it continues to be excellent thanks to gracious and warm staff!

Delicious sushi!!! I've become a regular patron at the $20-25 all you can eat/buffet sushi restaurants in the Chicagoland area. As I result, I think my taste buds have become accustomed to less expensive/fresh sushi.

I forgot how great really fresh sushi can taste. I got a Volcano and Chicago roll. They were both delicious! I may have to take a break on buffet spots and visit here more often.

When my friend and I arrived, the place was completely empty, which I would usually perceive as a red flag, but I already looked at the Yelp reviews so I expected it to be pretty tasty. I'm happy we didn't leave! Even though we were the only people dining at the restaurant, the service was kinda slow luckily I wasn't in a hurry.

I'll definitely be back!

Friend and I came here on a Friday evening at 6:30 - it was probably half empty and we were seated immediately.

We were given menus, but once we had decided our order, had a bit of a hard time trying to catch the eye of a waiter/waitress (sort of a free-for-all). We shared the sashimi appetizer ($12 for 6 pieces of fish - salmon, tuna, and whitefish), which was alright. The fish was okay, but the salmon was quite buttery!

Salmon Avocado Roll - lots of salmon, and quite worth it
Chicago Fire Roll - BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK $9 for fresh fish and some avocado!
Dynamite Roll - This was baked scallop topped with imitation, and definitely not worth the $13

Again, took a long time to get their attention to get the check and then process the payment.

This is conveniently placed, but the quality of the sushi and service matches the price.

This is more of a 3.5/5-- decent prices for decent sushi. The menu is pretty standard-- sashimi, traditional maki, and some specialty rolls. I quite liked the dynamite roll; not so much a fan of the West Town, which was a little too salty from the smoked salmon, or the Lobster Mania, which was a little too creamy. The udon (off the menu, but you can ask for it) is also not bad if you're craving something warm. 

The restaurant is on the small side and dimly lit in a strange/awkward way, and the seating is definitely on the cramped side. Overall, though, a nice place to get decent quality sushi for a fair price.

This by far the best sushi place I've been too. Every bite was fresh and melt in your mouth. We ordered the sashimi deluxe platter, unagi roll and yellowtail roll. 
Each bite was amazing and just made me want more. I would have ordered more salmon had I known it would be so delicious. I didn't care much for the mackerel. I think that's my least favorite. At least I tried and I know I don't like it. 
The restaurant is cozy and off the beaten path. There's about 10 tables in the restaurant. The staff is very friendly and greet you as soon as you walk in the door. Our waitress was very attentive and kept out tea cups filled. 
The carry out business does well. It's BYOB so there were quite a few tables that brought wine. 
I would definitely be coming back. The pics of other dishes look amazing.

Kai does a great job for being a smaller restaurant in a condo building. They have outdoor seating when the weather is nice, it's BYOB, and the prices and quality of fish are superb! We tend to eat here once a week. I really like the spicy crab roll, cucumber salad, and their specialty rolls. If you do pickup, they are really quick with orders, usually turning them around in 10-15 minutes during peak times. It's a rarity to have lower priced delicious sushi in this area, with Coast down on Wabash (yuck, not a fan of that location).

We got to the restaurant around 730 on Friday night and were the 3rd party in line. There was quite a bit of commotion squeezing waiting patrons and they have 5 chairs and limited standing room for those waiting for a table. Within about 15 mins, a hostess came and jotted down names of those waiting. Soon there after a table became available and the first 2 parties got into an argument about which of them was there first. It got uncomfortable quickly and I was glad my friend and I were seated quickly. For being such a popular restaurant, I expected better management of wait times and such.
We placed an order for 3 rolls and were brought 2 orders of cucumber salad which was light and refreshing! Our 3 rolls were served on 2 plates. The hamachi special roll had really thick slices of jalapeno and I had to remove them off my rolls. The Chicago fire roll was unevenly cut, which also surprised me. The ocean roll was the best of the 3 rolls and we ordered another along with the white tiger roll - the latter was ok and not as good as our second ocean roll.
The service was far from hospitable as various staff rushed us to leave. In fact, someone came to our table and asked if he could take our check before we had any cash or cards on the table. Next someone asked if we could move to another table since they had to join our table with another.
I was looking forward to eating here but overall, my experience left a lot to be desired. Not sure if I came on an off night, but there are plenty other spots I'd return to.

We spent a beautiful afternoon celebrating my daughters 12th birthday here and the food was absolutely delicious.  We don't mind that it wasn't the most swanky place in Chicago as long as the food is superior and it was very good sushi.  The seaweed salad was fresh and we had several rolls (avocado & California) for our youngest along with special rolls like the Dragon, Super Crunchy, & Rainbow.  All were great.  We will be back next time we visit and hope to get their red bean mochi and green tea ice cream as well.  Service was friendly and the chefs appreciated our positive reviews as we parted.  Great sushi place!

I'm a fan!  Loved their service and the Sushil was amazing.  We ordered miso with edamame as usual... What really got my taste buds excited was their specialty spicy tuna. 

Staff was very friendly, and the ambiance was casual.  We loved the corner table right behind the structure pole, BYOB made our experience even more enjoyable without worrying about a hefty $$ bill.  Chef stays in touch with his guest by sending something very special; ours was ice-cream.  I think that's a very good quality of any chef who typically doesn't get to see their guest but yet makes a connection with small gestures.  

overall a must try - little gem of a place!

Kai is our go-to place for sushi whether it's dining in or delivery. We recently had the chance to dine in again, and the food, of course, is delicious--we usually order tempura, tuna tataki, flaming VIP, caterpillar, volcano and ocean roll. Their cucumber salad is refreshing, and their green tea ice cream is a must!

I would give ten stars for the service, if I could, as it continues to be excellent thanks to gracious and warm staff!

Delicious sushi!!! I've become a regular patron at the $20-25 all you can eat/buffet sushi restaurants in the Chicagoland area. As I result, I think my taste buds have become accustomed to less expensive/fresh sushi.

I forgot how great really fresh sushi can taste. I got a Volcano and Chicago roll. They were both delicious! I may have to take a break on buffet spots and visit here more often.

When my friend and I arrived, the place was completely empty, which I would usually perceive as a red flag, but I already looked at the Yelp reviews so I expected it to be pretty tasty. I'm happy we didn't leave! Even though we were the only people dining at the restaurant, the service was kinda slow luckily I wasn't in a hurry.

I'll definitely be back!

Friend and I came here on a Friday evening at 6:30 - it was probably half empty and we were seated immediately.

We were given menus, but once we had decided our order, had a bit of a hard time trying to catch the eye of a waiter/waitress (sort of a free-for-all). We shared the sashimi appetizer ($12 for 6 pieces of fish - salmon, tuna, and whitefish), which was alright. The fish was okay, but the salmon was quite buttery!

Salmon Avocado Roll - lots of salmon, and quite worth it
Chicago Fire Roll - BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK $9 for fresh fish and some avocado!
Dynamite Roll - This was baked scallop topped with imitation, and definitely not worth the $13

Again, took a long time to get their attention to get the check and then process the payment.

This is conveniently placed, but the quality of the sushi and service matches the price.

This is more of a 3.5/5-- decent prices for decent sushi. The menu is pretty standard-- sashimi, traditional maki, and some specialty rolls. I quite liked the dynamite roll; not so much a fan of the West Town, which was a little too salty from the smoked salmon, or the Lobster Mania, which was a little too creamy. The udon (off the menu, but you can ask for it) is also not bad if you're craving something warm. 

The restaurant is on the small side and dimly lit in a strange/awkward way, and the seating is definitely on the cramped side. Overall, though, a nice place to get decent quality sushi for a fair price.

This by far the best sushi place I've been too. Every bite was fresh and melt in your mouth. We ordered the sashimi deluxe platter, unagi roll and yellowtail roll. 
Each bite was amazing and just made me want more. I would have ordered more salmon had I known it would be so delicious. I didn't care much for the mackerel. I think that's my least favorite. At least I tried and I know I don't like it. 
The restaurant is cozy and off the beaten path. There's about 10 tables in the restaurant. The staff is very friendly and greet you as soon as you walk in the door. Our waitress was very attentive and kept out tea cups filled. 
The carry out business does well. It's BYOB so there were quite a few tables that brought wine. 
I would definitely be coming back. The pics of other dishes look amazing.

Walked in a early Saturday afternoon for our "dinner". This has been on my list of places to check out since i saw good star ratings. Star ratings sell me along with pictures lol. As we walked in it was fairly empty which is cool with me, im assuming it was early and hot. We were greeted quickly and polite. They told us we could pick our seat. We were greeted with water & i believe a pretty small but very tasty cucumber salad. 

FOOD - Menu selection isn't huge but just enough to make selections. Our 2 appetizers and sushi that we ordered tasted amazing! 

DECOR/ATMOSPHERE - It is sort of small, i expected a little bigger but overall clean and decent light because of the large windows. I don't think they even had any lights on, on our visit. 

$$$ - Prices seemed average for sushi/asian

STAFF/SERVICE - Our visit was great service from the staff. 

Overall pleasant experience all around.

Nice Sushi Restaurant.  The place ain't fancy, but they have good sushi at a reasonable price.

I had their standard sushi platter.  It was quite nice with a nice assortment of Nigiri and a generous Tuna Roll.  The Miso soup was nice.  I splurged on the Seaweed salad.  For dessert, I had a Salmon roll and some Maguro tuna  and one piece of Toro fatty tuna.  

I would go back!

This is a lunch time sushi Yelp.  Came in for a quick sushi lunch and only had sushi and a salad.  The salad was good and the sushi was really fresh and tasty.  We had the flaming VIP and Ocean rolls off the regular menu and the spicy tuna and crab crunch roll off the pick two lunch special menu.  I liked the ocean roll the best.  The only problem we had was that I had to go inside and track down our waitress any time I wanted anything even though the place was practically empty.

It's also BYOB! Can't wait to come back.

Read most of the great reviews here about how fresh the sushi/sashimi is and how that blonde white male server is somewhat of a tool. 

The freshness of the sushi/sashimi being the BEST on Chicago is (in my opinion) untrue. And if it is true, then I feel bad for the general population of sushi livers here. 

The latter part of my original first statement is true. That server is quite a tool as he really rushes the orders and seems in it only for tips. And if part A isn't up to standard, then part B will never really amount to much for him. 

I ordered the octopus salad. Extremely underwhelming as the octopus seemed a bit old which borderlined stale... My spicy tuna roll was quite bland for a spicy tuna roll. I was surprised about that. My sashimi appetizer was also "just ok" as I was hoping for a really smooth melt-in-your-mouth texture. It was not much different from a pre-packaged Saran-wrapped take out sashimi. 

Best part was when I asked if they took AMEX and the owner came to me and said "we do, but I don't like to take it because the merchant fee is too high". 

He ended up taking it after we both made fun of how high the fees were compared to the other major credit cards. 

If you don't want to take AMEX, then don't have a "we proudly accept AMEX" sign at your establishment and don't tell me you take it when I ask.

Kai Sushi is an amazing sushi restaurant in Chicago because both the food and service are amazing. In regards to food, they give each person a cucumber salad appetizer and a creatively peeled and cut orange at the end of the meal. The cucumber salad is quite flavorful and prepares your appetite for the entrees. Both my girlfriend and I had such a wonderful experience here that we came back for lunch twice during our spring break vacation in Chicago. My gf really appreciated the kind waitress and loved her useful recommendations on what rolls to order. For our first time here, we ordered both the ocean roll and the flaming VIP roll. Make sure to request getting the special sauce on the side of the plate because it's amazing! The rolls are also an extremely good value because the most expensive roll is usually $12.95 and each roll comes with 8-9 pieces of sushi. In regards to the ocean roll, it was made of shrimp tempura, avocado and topped with tuna. The gf thought this was the best roll, so it must be pretty amazing! Personally, I preferred the flaming VIP because it was made of spicy crab topped with salmon and sweet soy sauce. Honestly with either roll you can't go wrong! The ingredients are extremely fresh and you can watch the sushi chefs prepare your roll. In regards to our last visit, we ordered the dragon roll, the green curry beef udon (which was the daily special), and the Mochi ice cream for dessert. The dragon roll was also fabulous and was made from shrimp tempura (so good!), cucumber and cream cheese. It was topped off with eel and avocado. In regards to the green curry beef udon, it was an amazing value for only $9. It came with a large portion of beef and the curry sauce was not too spicy, but packed with aromatic flavor. If you ever see this on the daily special menu, make sure to try it out. Lastly, the Mochi ice cream dessert was an amazing dessert because you get a choice of two Mochi flavors: the GF and I went with red bean and mango. The Mochi was extremely soft and the ice cream filling paired extremely well to end off a perfect meal. Overall, if you are in Chicago and you are a foodie, you have to try out Kai Sushi. It's one of the best hidden gems of Chicago!

I was a bit shocked to learn I haven't written a review for Kai yet, considering how many times I've been here, and the fact it makes the best sushi in the city. The fish tastes super fresh and the sauces are just delicious. This little South Loop gem is a short walk from Museum Campus, and has limited outdoor and indoor seating (we like both). Service is super nice, super smiley, and super fast. Always listen to the specials from the nice server before making your order. Rolls I highly recommend include: Lobster Madness, Dragon Roll, and Super Crunchy roll.

Came at about 5pm on a weekday and it was empty.

However, the food was delicious. My boyfriend had the chirashi and I had a sushi regular. He enjoyed his chirashi a lot. He said that the egg was cooked so that it tasted so light that he didn't know it was an egg to begin with. 

My sushi was delicious. We also ordered the days special of Chu toro sushi and it was so creamy, just as the waitress described. 

Would return, recommend, good for groups as well.

My experience here was good overall mainly because I really enjoyed the service. They bring you a little cucumber salad appetizer and end your meal with an artfully peeled and sliced orange. The server was attentive and brought the food out quickly, but the sushi left me feeling a little underwhelmed. Maybe I just ordered the wrong rolls, but a lot of their sushi includes cream cheese in it, which isn't my thing so I felt a bit limited by the options. The menu isn't extensive but there's a little bit for everyone. I always order my go-to California roll, and the ones here tasted like a cafeteria version, granted they are on the lower price point. I would suggest skipping this one. I also tried the dancing eel roll, which was my least favorite, I've never had a sweet sushi roll before and I'm definitely not a fan of the taste. My favorite was the dynamite roll, the sushi was covered with a warm layer of imitation crab mixture and tasted the best of all the rolls I ordered. Despite not being blown away by the sushi, I wouldn't mind returning.

Really good cheap sushi. Nothing is super fancy but for the price it's great. BYOB. Outdoor seating. Service slightly slow but always friendly. I've only had one bad roll there and it's because I don't like raw scallop and it was a special they had going, and since every scallop roll I've had has always been cooked I just assumed it would be too.

Kai Sushi looks like a fast food type sushi restaurant, which it probably is, but the sushi was surprisingly good! The bf and I bused/walked our way here in the rain last June, and it was worth it. The staff was super friendly, and I believe the serve who helped us had just visited SF so we chatted for a bit.

As I said earlier, this place is definitely comes off as a place where you'd order to go rather than sit down and eat. The menus they give you when you dine in are paper brochure menus, like a to-go menu pretty much. No big deal, but

We mainly ordered rolls and then a couple nigiri just to try. I believe we had the Ocean, White Tiger, Hamachi Special and Chicago Fire rolls. Unfortunately, I don't recall which nigiri we had -- scallops for sure, and it was good! The bf and I enjoyed Kai muchhh more than Umai. The sushi was fresh and all the rolls were delicious.

Definitely recommend Kai Sushi if you're visiting, or living in, Chicago!

Great place, always order delivery. Lots of choices and the quality is great. Can't lose. The first time I went for dinner was great, friendly, quick service and they were playing Billy Joel's greatest hits which was a plus!

Came at about 5pm on a weekday and it was empty.

However, the food was delicious. My boyfriend had the chirashi and I had a sushi regular. He enjoyed his chirashi a lot. He said that the egg was cooked so that it tasted so light that he didn't know it was an egg to begin with. 

My sushi was delicious. We also ordered the days special of Chu toro sushi and it was so creamy, just as the waitress described. 

Would return, recommend, good for groups as well.

My experience here was good overall mainly because I really enjoyed the service. They bring you a little cucumber salad appetizer and end your meal with an artfully peeled and sliced orange. The server was attentive and brought the food out quickly, but the sushi left me feeling a little underwhelmed. Maybe I just ordered the wrong rolls, but a lot of their sushi includes cream cheese in it, which isn't my thing so I felt a bit limited by the options. The menu isn't extensive but there's a little bit for everyone. I always order my go-to California roll, and the ones here tasted like a cafeteria version, granted they are on the lower price point. I would suggest skipping this one. I also tried the dancing eel roll, which was my least favorite, I've never had a sweet sushi roll before and I'm definitely not a fan of the taste. My favorite was the dynamite roll, the sushi was covered with a warm layer of imitation crab mixture and tasted the best of all the rolls I ordered. Despite not being blown away by the sushi, I wouldn't mind returning.

I feel like they use too much sauce on rolls, but they are still pretty decent. Overall, I had a good time there and food was alright. I liked how they allow byob. I'd go there again.

Really good cheap sushi. Nothing is super fancy but for the price it's great. BYOB. Outdoor seating. Service slightly slow but always friendly. I've only had one bad roll there and it's because I don't like raw scallop and it was a special they had going, and since every scallop roll I've had has always been cooked I just assumed it would be too.

Kai Sushi looks like a fast food type sushi restaurant, which it probably is, but the sushi was surprisingly good! The bf and I bused/walked our way here in the rain last June, and it was worth it. The staff was super friendly, and I believe the serve who helped us had just visited SF so we chatted for a bit.

As I said earlier, this place is definitely comes off as a place where you'd order to go rather than sit down and eat. The menus they give you when you dine in are paper brochure menus, like a to-go menu pretty much. No big deal, but

We mainly ordered rolls and then a couple nigiri just to try. I believe we had the Ocean, White Tiger, Hamachi Special and Chicago Fire rolls. Unfortunately, I don't recall which nigiri we had -- scallops for sure, and it was good! The bf and I enjoyed Kai muchhh more than Umai. The sushi was fresh and all the rolls were delicious.

Definitely recommend Kai Sushi if you're visiting, or living in, Chicago!

Watching the marine life at Shedd's Aquarium nearby put us in a sushi mood.  Haha, I swear we're good people - don't judge!

It was a lovely sunny day, so after a pedicab ride over (too far to walk, when you're hungry!) I was thrilled to see their patio seating.  We were served quickly, and for this sushi snob, everything was truly top notch:

Chirashi Sushi - tamago, white tuna, yellowtail, albacore and salmon on perfectly vinegared sushi rice

Uni Sashimi - super fresh, smaller pieces of dark orange uni from Hokkaido

Deluxe Sashimi Platter - salmon, snapper, albacore, white tuna, tuna

Service was gracious and polite, and lunch here was exactly what we wanted.  

I'd absolutely recommend coming here for sushi!

I had dinner here on Saturday night. I made a reservation much earlier in the week and had no issues or even a slight wait for our table. The waitress was very welcoming and reviewed all the specials. We ordered 4 different veggie rolls, edamame, and a large Garden Salad. Get the salad. It was actually my favorite dish. It has this ginger orange dressing amazingness on it and toasted sesame seeds. The large size is perfect for 2. A perfect compliment to a summer meal. I will definitely be back.

This has become my go to sushi place in the South loop and the fish is always fresh and the portions generous. All of my fellow South loopers love this place too. I recently moved to SF and I miss how good and cheap Kai is.

Service is always prompt and friendly.

The downside is that while they are still BYOB, they do charge a fee per person if you bring booze...including those that didn't partake. You might want to clarify this if you plan on BYOB and have some non-drinkers in the group.

This is probably my favorite sushi place in Chicago so far. We ordered two specialty rolls, the Green Turtle and Chicago Fire. Both were simple, yet very flavorful. The Green Turtle had mango in it, which complimented the fish and avocado very well. The fish were fresh and just melted in your mouth. We also ordered the special of the day -- salmon belly sushi. Absolutely amazing. Some sushi places get too fancy with their rolls, whereas at Kai, they focus on the fish, which is how it should be. The staff was also wonderful. We will be back.

When I first walked in I was impressed. It was a nice little spot. I really like the atmosphere. I had called in an order. I was told it was going to take 30 minutes for 2 philly rolls. I was confused but I went with it. I waited 30 minutes before leaving home. When I got there the hostesses were running around. They looked stressed and unkept. The one with the glasses greeted me. She went to go get my order (at least I thought) when she got to the bar I heard her ask for 2 philly rolls. I was disappointed that I waited the full 30 minutes and my order still wasn't ready. I gave them the benefit of doubt and blamed it on the being busy. Another guy walked in and picked up a take out order as well. He had 2 containers full of sushi (I'm nosy) he got his in 5 minutes or less. I was still waiting. I look around and I see the hostess with the glasses on her phone checking messages. I wasn't really upset until I got home. I love sushi. I get the same thing wherever o go. I know avocados are in a philly roll not cucumber. On top of that my roll had a few mashed pieces. I went from impressed to very unsatisfied I'm 30 minutes. 
I thought this was a good place but I guess I came on the wrong day.

I normally order 2-3 rolls at sushi restaurants to fill me up. In this case, I only ordered one because I had a hot yoga class right after. Just not a good idea to stuff my face if I don't want to die.

The restaurant would be cuter in the evening, when it's not sunny outside. The lack of lights inside combined with the sun shining through the huge windows didn't make a warm atmosphere. They have outdoor seating, which is nice for the summertime.

The service was friendly and attentive. No complaints there.

I ordered an Ocean roll as recommended on Yelp. My first impression was "Wow, that's a lot of sauce on the plate......and swirled so nicely!" The roll was really good. I was trying so hard to savor each bite, which was very, very difficult to do. I would definitely recommend ordering the Ocean roll.

I'll be back to try the other rolls because one is not enough!

Kai is quickly becoming my go-to place for fresh, reasonably-priced sushi. It's right next to the Roosevelt Red Line stop, so it's really convenient to get there by public transportation. The Ocean Roll is my favorite, and the Chicago Fire Roll has generous chunks of fresh fish in it. The check for two specialty rolls came to a little under $30 after tax and tip. It's not exactly a budget option, but for the quality of the fish, I'd say it's well worth the price for when you're hungry but not starving. We had great service while we were here as well - the waiter was really attentive and even refilled our water when he noticed there was no ice. They also give a complimentary cucumber salad to each person at the table. I will definitely take friends back here again.

Pretty fresh fish I must say.

Service was also accommodating.  The manager stopped by us and a few others checking if everything was good.

For the food, I would say this is very average sushi, nothing really stand out, but I guess given the price, it is supposed to be just a neighborhood restaurant. The rice's texture is not that good, and a bit too much rice vinegar. the fish quality is very much so so.

In my opinion one of the best sushi places in the city. It's not flashy, it's not trendy, but it is comfortable, BYOB, fresh, and has good service. The spicy tuna is hands down the best in the city. It's simple and yet done to perfection! Highly recommend! They give a complimentary cucumber salad that cannot be replicated (I've tried) and orange at the of your meal. They have a lunch special every day from 11-3 which is a great deal! In the summer they have a really nice patio! It's. it's all the time so get there early and bring your wine! So happy this place stayed opened I was nervous when they left Grand Ave.

The Food tasted very good, BUT there is AN IMPORTANT HEALTH issue. I took PICTURES of the three CHEFS who were preparing the sushi rolls, one of them HAD NO GLOVES COVERING HIS HANDS! which puts customers in a SERIOUS risk of FOOD POISONING! 
This gloves-less guy even picked something that fell on the floor while he was working, dusted off his hands and went back to work again and I SAW HIM! 
When I asked the waitress why this guy isn't taking food handling precautions in consideration aka no gloves, her answer was "well I know some Italian places who don't abide by food handling precautions as well!", REALLY??? 
I wouldn't count on someone's personal view of how clean their hands should be when IT COMES TO THE FOOD THAT I'M EATING! 

Ps : I'll upload the evidence to the pictures section of this profile

I went there last night for dinner. We ordered seaweed salad and three rolls - Dancing Eel, Ocean, & West Town. Ocean was definitely my favorite among all three. Dancing Eel was very good, but it was a little too sweet. West Town would have been very good had I not ordered the other two rolls. Overall, this is a good sushi place. 

The reason I didn't give a 5-star rating was that the service was a little bit slow.

In my opinion one of the best sushi places in the city. It's not flashy, it's not trendy, but it is comfortable, BYOB, fresh, and has good service. The spicy tuna is hands down the best in the city. It's simple and yet done to perfection! Highly recommend! They give a complimentary cucumber salad that cannot be replicated (I've tried) and orange at the of your meal. They have a lunch special every day from 11-3 which is a great deal! In the summer they have a really nice patio! It's. it's all the time so get there early and bring your wine! So happy this place stayed opened I was nervous when they left Grand Ave.

I went there last night for dinner. We ordered seaweed salad and three rolls - Dancing Eel, Ocean, & West Town. Ocean was definitely my favorite among all three. Dancing Eel was very good, but it was a little too sweet. West Town would have been very good had I not ordered the other two rolls. Overall, this is a good sushi place. 

The reason I didn't give a 5-star rating was that the service was a little bit slow.

The Food tasted very good, BUT there is AN IMPORTANT HEALTH issue. I took PICTURES of the three CHEFS who were preparing the sushi rolls, one of them HAD NO GLOVES COVERING HIS HANDS! which puts customers in a SERIOUS risk of FOOD POISONING! 
This gloves-less guy even picked something that fell on the floor while he was working, dusted off his hands and went back to work again and I SAW HIM! 
When I asked the waitress why this guy isn't taking food handling precautions in consideration aka no gloves, her answer was "well I know some Italian places who don't abide by food handling precautions as well!", REALLY??? 
I wouldn't count on someone's personal view of how clean their hands should be when IT COMES TO THE FOOD THAT I'M EATING! 

Ps : I'll upload the evidence to the pictures section of this profile

Fantastic sushi for a great price! I didn't realize it was BYOB but there's a supermarket right next door.

Service was prompt. Food came out as described. Their specialty rolls are really quite good. I had the Chicago and Dragon rolls which were superb. Flavorful without overpowering the fishs' unique tastes. Highly recoomend!

The South Loop dining scene has been bombing lately, and one of the hidden gems is Kai. Located close to the EL and CTA stops, the location is ideal for those on public transit, there is street parking but if you're visiting at peak hours you may have to circle. 

As a vegetarian my favorite roll is the "Shiitake Special Roll", which at $10 is a steal, as per my dining companions the sashimi is fresh, and there are a variety of options so that everyone at your table will leave with a full tummy at a price that won't hurt your wallet. The fresh oranges they serve when you request your check is a nice touch. 

The service is as relaxed as the atmosphere, the servers are friendly and do not hesitate to bring you ice or drink ware as needed. This BYOB spot is an ideal place to chit chat with your pals after work and share the news of the week.

Kai is one of those sushi places that don't disappoint. Despite its location it is a great spot to try great and very cheap sushi and enjoy some wine thanks to its BYOB policy. 

Last time I went we had the super crunchy sushi roll, the lobster mania roll, and the spicy tuna (recommend to ask for some tempura on top, and / or avocado). My favorite is the Sakura Blossom, served with slightly warm salmon and tempura and sweet soy sauce. 

Tip: ask the waiter for the specials, sometimes they serve items not on the menu that are worth trying.

And they have an outside seating area perfect for the summer nights!

What a cute little gem! I just moved to Chicago from NYC and have found most sushi places to be very mediocre (except the really high end ones). Kai sushi changed that for me. Prices are fair and the food is amazing. Every roll we ordered was good. My husband is vegetarian and he tried the veg rolls which were as good as the other rolls we were all eating. The patio is really nice to sit on a warm day. BYOB- if you are more than 4 people they charge a fee of $3 per person for the byob which I think is very fair. The best part- they give these oranges which are super sweet and very interestingly cut. So glad I came here and will definitely be a regular moving forward

Not bad but not great. This place had some very standard sushi but it was all well prepared. I wouldnt say the service was slow but it wasnt exactly fast. The lunch time crowd was mixed with casual diners and business people alike. 

I do think the prices were a bit high for this joint but thats just because they were on a level with some of the better sushi places in town.

We have been frequent customers at Kai for the last two years since we live nearby. It was a convenient BYOB near where we lived with decent food. However, after our most recent experience, we will NEVER go back and urge others to do the same. 

We came with another couple and their two toddler children. At the outset, we were informed that it would be $3 a person for wine since we "were a party of over 5"- they included the children in that count. We had never heard of a corkage fee and it was not listed on the menu. The waitress was nasty and disrespectful to us the entire meal. I can't think of any reason why she would be other than our brown skin. The icing on the cake was getting a bill with 18% gratuity added (again, not stated on the menu) since again "we were a party of over 5", again including the two kids under 3 years old. When we asked why gratuity was included, the waitress stated she was not the manager and briskly walked away. 

Avoid this place unless you want to be disrespected and overcharged with ludicrous fees. The added racism probably doesn't help either.

Low-key environment, good service, great sushi.  What's not to love?  A friend of mine and I had dinner on the patio last night.  We were seated and immediately brought a small cucumber salad while we looked over the menu.  We started with edamame (for some reason I MUST have edamame to munch on when I go out for sushi); I would've put a little more salt on it, but I'm a salt person.

Now for the rolls- we shared the White Tiger, West Town, and Dragon.  All three were delicious, and very fresh.  I was a little thrown off by the pink color of the soy paper wrap on the West Town, but everything tasted great.  We ordered two rolls first, and then added a third later.  It wasn't a problem at all for us to relax and take our time in between orders.  Don't you just love not being rushed when you're enjoying a good meal?

Service- our waitress was very friendly, attentive to our water glasses, and chatted casually with us at the end of our meal.  I love a place where you get just the right amount of attention; I don't want to be bothered every 5 seconds, and I don't want to sit for 30 minutes without a server stopping by.  This was perfect.

The restaurant is BYOB, but even if you forget to BYO, there's a Jewel right around the corner.

This is a solid go-to place for sushi.  You should definitely check it out.

There have been times on the weekend where I've had to wait 40minutes for my meal, but it usually doesn't take that long. I've also gotten take out here, and the quality is the same as if you were to eat in. My favorite rolls here are the Chicago Fire, Shitake special, and super crunchy.

Went here with a few friends last week.  Place was crowded on a weeknight so we were glad we had a reservation.  Service was prompt and efficient. 

We had edamame to start and 1 bowl was good for 4 people. Everyone got their entrees at the same time.  Portions were good size (soup bowl is huge!) and we all got different rolls which were great, with the volcano roll being the standout. 

One star off because no one came by to check on us or refill the water glasses, but we all said we would definitely go back.

Ate here with a colleague while in town for work. Picked Kai Sushi because it had a half stat more than other sushi places in the area. Glad we did, because it's fantastic. Portions are generous for a reasonable price. Their maki and nigiri are equally good (try the Chicago Fire Roll). Staff was courteous. My colleague and I split one last role, and the waitress had no problem splitting just that roll between our two checks.

Hubba hubba - Raisu, I love you.  This is easily the best sushi I've had, ever.  Don't be fooled by the location, artisans are at work here. 

The seafood soup with crabmeat and lobster is five star restaurant quality in taste and presentation.  We also had the golden calamari and the soft shell crab bites, which were similarly ethereal.  Not heavy at all and a great way to start the meal.  The calamari comes on a bed of lettuce if you need some greens.

For our mains, we started with a three piece sampling of toro, which was lightly lacquered in a house sauce - no soy dipping necessary (or provided).  This fatty tuna was the finest fish I've ever tasted - ever.  I ate slowly for my eyes were rolling into my brain in ecstasy as it melted in my mouth.

We moved on to salmon maki, salmon roe, spicy tuna maki, unagi maki, and then unagi nigiri.  It was all divine, especially the ikura and the unagi.  

We ended our dinner with fresh uni, which was shipped in that day from Japan - Hokkaido, I believe - and it was a revelation.  Full of funky flavor, yet smooth and devoid of bitterness, it was the finest uni I've had.  Coated with yolk from a quail egg, you must eat it with your hands for a finger licking good indulgence.

If you have the wherewithal to save room for dessert, the green tea mochi and strawberry crepe layer cake are both worthy of your discretion.

Be sure to explore the sake selections here.  The manager was kind enough to offer us an off-the-menu option, Junmai Daiginjo.  It was my introduction to sake and I loved it - mild, mellow, and creamy, it was a wonderful pairing with the fish.

We topped the evening off with some Japanese whiskey.  Get Nikka Pure Malt if you are a Lagavulin fan, or the Akashi Ume if you like milder fruit notes in your whiskey.  Both are fantastic.

This is a hidden gem but sushi lovers owe it to themselves to make the pilgrimage and support its artisanship.

Man oh man. What a great place to open up after all the other restaurants that were here formerly. The food is amazing, you can tell the quality and care of the fish that's served here. The chef's touch on their signature nigiri was artistic and executed with finesse   and thought. 

We're over the AYCE sushi game and Raisu has become our go-to! Definitely give this place a try and keep it alive in our neighborhood!

2.5 stars. 

BF called to make a reservation for a Saturday evening dinner. He asked if they could accommodate us at 5pm and the person on the phone said "no, come at 8:30pm." BF then asked if we could just walk in and wait to be seated and he said, "no, you may not." .... ok... so we booked the 8:30 spot.

We arrive early (8pm ish) and call them from the car to see if they could take us earlier, and they say, "no we're very busy - you'll have to wait." At this point we both think this place is doing very well just after 3 months of opening and think the yelp hype is true. I tell BF we should just go in and have a drink at the bar while we wait. We walk in and there are about 7 places we could be seated at. Hmmm, anyway, we check in with the hostess and get seated at a 4-top within minutes.

The decor is very tacky - very late 90s "hip" japanese (-american) restaurant style, if that makes any sense. The place still reeks of fresh paint, has fake flower embellishments along the windows, and most of the dishes they use have matching flower designs on them. 

Service was great - can't complain.

We were told that anything "salmon" was unavailable for the night.

1. The white tuna sashimi dish we had was quite tasty - although the flavor of the fish was overpowered by secondary ingredients (mango, apple, lychee). 

2. We ordered the spider, in which fried soft shell crab along with cherry tomatoes and... i want to say lettuce?!?! were wrapped in cucumber. Although it wasn't what we were expecting (we expected a more meaty and less overpowered soft shell crab that actually tasted like soft shell crab), the dish itself was delicious. However, if no one had told me the name of this dish, I wouldn't have known what it was.

3. We then had the Ebi (shrimp) Tempura maki. Again, way too much embellishments and was overly sauced, the essence of the dish (flavor of the shrimp) was pretty much lost.

4. BF had fried tofu, which he liked. I agreed it was fried just right. The dish consisted of 6 blocks of fried tofu on a bed of spring greens, which I loved, but the yuzu-infused (i believe) teriyaki(?) sauce was too thick and strong that it couldn't be widely dispersed onto other ingredients.

5. I ordered 4 pieces of nigiri: madai, signature madai, jumbo botan ebi, and the whopping $15 uni from hokkaido. ***WAYYYY TOO MUCH SHARI, and the shari is overcooked - I would've liked a bit more texture. 

-Madai felt a bit soggy and lacking texture as well, and the garlic chips on the signature madai made the fish taste like dirt. 
-The ebi was great - the fried head is always a delicacy. 
-UNI from Hokkaido. First of all, $15 for a piece of uni nigiri is excessive - absolutely and stupidly overpriced. (Sadly, I craved it too much to pass on it) As a true uni fanatic, I enjoy having a simple uni nigiri topped with nothing but uni. After our server (who had a very strong eastern European accent) gave me a very thorough, but an incomprehensible explanation about this $15/piece uni, I asked her for a nigiri with simply uni and shari. She took my order and shortly after brought out my plate. When I noticed it was topped with ikura and quail egg, I asked her if the chef can make it with just the uni, she said she'll go and check with the chef. When she came back with the chef's answer to my question, I was totally dumbfounded. "Yes, we can, but the uni nigiri without its toppings will be too FISHY." Whoa.

So... I wonder if all this over-embellishments are a way to camouflage the perhaps poor qualities of the main ingredients. I just don't get how this place has good reviews. 

I'll just stick to my regular go-to sushi spots.

You know that episode of the Simpsons where Marge admits that after a sushi dinner, Homer had to go fishing to get his fill? That was basically us after the omakase we had this evening. $75 per person and we had to then order ala carte to leave satisfied. We have done omakase in Tokyo, NYC, and pretty much when available and lack of food has never been an issue. The sushi itself was good and above the subpar options available in Chicago, but it doesn't exactly live up to the hype and definitely not worth the price.

The best sashimi and nigiri place in Chicago ! We ordered omakase, which means chef decide your meal based on what they have that day .

My favorites are the otoro, uni and House special salmon . Will definitely come back ! Glad we found this place :)

I'm so so disappointed.  The Toro flight was good because of the quality of the tuna... But all their sushi rice was so disgusting and mushy.  It felt like eating a mushy ball of rice that took away from the taste of the sushi.  I never knew you could mess up the quality of rice at a sushi restaurant.  Definitely not authentic to serve mushy rice!

Hands down the best sushi I've had in my entire life. I've even been to Japan and I really thought the way Raisu did sushi matched my palate the best. 

I heard about Raisu through Yelp posts so I made a reservation for Saturday night. We thought the service was A+. Our waitress was very nice and she explained every dish that came out, and always asked how we were doing. The chef also came out and asked us what we thought and how we were doing. He explained that his teachers always prepared sushi with the savory flavors in mind, using mushrooms etc to garnish. He said he preferred a sweet flavor, so he incorporated a lot of fruit. This was true because our specialty nigiri often had a fruit-based sauce-- like pineapple or apple. It was delicious and unique. I loved every moment of it. 

At Raisu they let you order as you want from the menu, or choose an omakase meal that starts at $50 (the chef hand selects a menu for your table). We went with a $75/person omakase and we loved every part of it. Our favorites were the house-marinated ikura, uni, and sea scallops. This was EXTREMELY fresh sushi... I can never do sushi the same way ever again!! By the end of our meal we were so full and satisfied. We even ordered the green tea crepe cake as dessert because the meal was so good we had to try their dessert too. A+ !!! If you are in the area and are in the mood to treat yoself... or celebrate something special, please check out Raisu!!

Shout out to fellow Yelpers for helping me find this sushi goldmine in Irving Park. By far the BEST miso soup, spicy tuna, and specialty tempura rolls I've ever had. Their seafood is flown in fresh and directly from Japan. You can taste the difference. The miso soup has a very rich broth and was outstanding.  The spicy tuna and specialty tempura had just the right amount of kick and amazing flavor. 

And don't let the prices deter you. You get what you pay for. If you're  looking for high-quality seafood via Japanese sashimi & sushi entrees look no further. Check this place out asap.

I also brought along my 6-yr old son & 3-yr old niece for an early dinner at 5pm. My son adores sushi especially california rolls and exclaimed after eating a special creation of non-spicy Alaskan King Crab california roll: "This is the best sushi I've had in my life!!!!" 

Both kids really enjoyed the udon noodle soup, miso soup as well as the strawberry mochi ice cream & green tea cake for dessert.

Our waiter, Hamlet, was amazing and helped with everything from menu suggestions for me to sushi modifications (e.g. not spicy) for the kids. He was attentive to our every need & answered several questions my inquisitive son had about the restaurant & food. 

Definitely family friendly which was reassuring given the high end look of the place.  If dining with kids I would strongly recommend stopping in during lunch hours or around 5pm before dinner rush hits.

I definitely plan to be back with adults only to enjoy the menu specials.

Note: I haven't traveled to Japan but did live for several years in Michigan near Japanese auto industry firms/suppliers & the great sushi restaurants they patronized. Also tried top rated sushi joints from west coast to east coast during travels. This place is by far the best I've ever had!!!

Came back here a week later with some friends and the service was top notch. The food was just as good as last time. This time we brought a couple of bottles and took advantage of the $15 cork fee. Then we ordered a grilled squid app which came on a bed of salad. It was good but the best part was the sashimi, it's so fresh and priced pretty well considering the quality (the fish is flown in from Japan, never frozen). 
The manager, Jack, stopped by again to make sure everything was perfect, he recognized us and offered us a complimentary crepe cake dessert. I had the green tea one and it was great, definitely different. Our server was awesome, she was very thorough when answering everyone's questions, she was attentive and friendly. 
I'm so excited to have this place in the neighborhood, I will definitely be a regular!

Was very disappointed in this place even understanding it is fairly new, I would have left
2 stars aside from the fact they are new. They had three beers and the only one I liked they didn't have at first, then they found the last one! The server was very nice. We ordered the edamame which was very good but took a long time to come out, the chefs special yellowtail was so fresh and tasty but also took a long time to come out. We waited forever for our main sushi order but in the end we left as I had waited long enough, and couldn't order another beer while I waited. I felt sorry for the server as he was embarrassed and didn't  want to come back to our table to apologize further . To their credit they offered a discount if we waited a few minutes longer or would comp what we had already but in my mind the food would have been tainted by the experience. Left a tip for the server as not his fault and he was good at his job. I plan to go back in about a month and try it again as the food was very good ( what I had anyway) hopefully they will be a bit more organized and I can change this review.

This is one of the best sushi restaurants in the city that you have never heard of. The staff is friendly and is very, very knowledgeable. The presentation is Michelin Star level. 

The fish is flown in directly from Japan and is incredibly delicious and fresh. You could forego the soy sauce and just enjoy the amazing flavor. The bluefin tuna was a standout and was suburb. 

This will be my neighborhood sushi joint now. I hope they thrive and attract visitors from other parts of the city. They are a great addition to this up and coming neighborhood. 

Can't wait to see how they expand and hope they will consider adding a traditional Japanese house salad with ginger dressing. I always love them and that was the only thing missing from the menu.

Searching Yelp for something new, Raisu came up and we found they had just opened recently. We made reservations and drove over to the restaurant. The location was artfully decorated and the chefs wore bright blue ties and vests, quite interesting to say the least. 

We had to wait about 10 minutes for our table, however given they just opened their business we felt it was to be expected. The wait staff was very friendly and brought our drinks out promptly. My green tea was absolutely amazing and my husband's Pinot noir was deep and delicious. We eat out at quite a few sushi restaurants and I have to say this was the first place that didn't automatically bring out wasabi and soy sauce with our sashimi and nigiri plates - the fish quality was outstanding. We seriously didn't need it, it was that good! 

I ordered the tuna sashimi and the salmon "rose" sashimi appetizer, just melted in my mouth. The tuna appetizer had a bit of a kick to it, and again we didn't need any wasabi. I also had the house miso soup which came out hot and flavorful. The waitstaff also brought us out some hot edamame because the food took a little longer to cook. Very impressed with the food presentations and the level of service. The place was very packed and I hope they continue to do well during their debut month! Would absolutely go back again.

Wow. Serious Sushi on a busy section of Irving Park. Who would have thunk it??

They are having their soft opening right now and Jack, the manager, has created an inspired, exciting and most importantly; DELICIOUS menu for all of us to enjoy. 

This not being your standard run of the mill sushi joint, Raisu has meticulously crafted marinades and sauces for their signature nigiri to bring a lot of excitement to dinner. 

Our favorites were the Unagi with Parmesan cheese and truffle oil, a special Japanese (huge) shrimp with honey and a spicy marinade, and a maguro bluefin tuna with grilled pineapple and garlic! FANTASTIC! 

Also, we LOVED the LIVE scallop appetizer that was as creamy, silky smooth as could be, with a light ponzu sauce brush that was phenomenal. Not sure if it will be a regular but we can only hope! 

Well done, Raisu. 10/10 will dine here again!

Having travelled to Japan, and had my fair share of good sushi, I wasn't necessarily holding my breath for this new spot in my neighborhood, but having heard good things about it and looked at their menu, wow, was I pleasantly surprised. The sushi at Raisu is probably one of the best in the city, it is not everywhere in the city that you can find this deep of a selection of fresh Japanese seafood. They have everything from Uni, to Toro and Hokkaido Scallops, if you're familiar with Japanese food, you know some of these ingredients are hard to come by, here in Chicago.

On top of that, the service is personal, and attentive, the server took her time to explain every item in the menu, and made some very poignant suggestions. We ended up having a couple of makis, and I just couldn't pass on the Toro flight, and Uni nigiri, both of which were superb. The rice was spot on, and the seafood was phenomenal.

This is not just a neighborhood joint, this is high level japanese food, that warrants a trip if you're anywhere in the city. Fantastic job!

I'd been avoiding this place because it's in a space that has had a series of mediocre and terribly-named restaurants ("Burgers N' Barley Pop". Really.) since the building was completed 7-8 years ago. I thought it was just another effort by the same owner to re-brand. If it is, he's finally hit on something!

I got carry out, and I was surprised at how much work has been done to the interior. It's warm and inviting, and as someone concerned with local business -- there were actual people there! The staff were friendly, and best of all, my sushi was really good. Fresh and presented well - not easy for carry out - skillfully made and delicious.

If you are lucky enough to order bluefin tuna here, make sure to pair it with Dassai 50 as your drink! First feeling the otoro melting in your mouth like floating in heaven, then have the apple slices on side( it is not just for  garnishing) now have your drink, you will literally got the taste of The Garden of Eden!  The sweet shrimp nigiri is my must have every time. Wrapping up the  day with some Japanese whisky is a plus plus! Best birthday ever!

Yas!  Dined here last night because 1. we had a babysitter (aka grandparents), 2. husband wanted otoro, 3. we wanted somewhere close to home, 4. we wanted a fancy-ish meal but also didn't want to dress up.  This place pretty much fulfilled all of that!  To start, we had the Tuna Tartare and House Special Seafood Soup - yum and yum.  I ordered 3 of the special nigiri - Hon Maguro (bluefin tuna), Hamachi (yellowtail), and Jumbo Botan Ebi (sweet shrimp).  ALL of these were delicious, but the shrimp and the bluefin were my favorites!  I should've ordered another shrimp.  Husband ordered a flight of Otoro nigiri, which had 3 pieces...and then proceeded to order a 2nd flight of the same.  So....he liked it. Clearly.  We also ordered a spicy tuna roll, which we should've skipped and should've ordered more special nigiri instead.  A bit on the pricier side, but worth it for the quality.  Wish the drink choices were better, but the sushi is what we came for. :)

This new spot has the best sushi in the city. I have been all over to a lot of places;buffets, all-u-can-eat, conveyor belt, all kinds. This spot has the freshest I have ever had since Hotel Nikko Chicago was here. There is a reason that there is no soy sauce on the table. The sushi is so full of flavor, soy sauce would only hurt the flavor. The experence is not inexpensive. It is worth every penny. If you have a chance, go. Spend the money and experience what a sushi restaurant should be. Bring me the oysters, the sea urchin, the abalone, and the sea cucumbers. This is the kind if place that will bring a sushi fan into g h e unknown for a new experience.  Get it before it's gone. 115.00 for myself with one 16 dollar sake. The flavor is outstanding and the rolls are fat. Worth the price. The grenades are superb !

My first time eating here and so glad I finally was able to. The freshest fish I've had in Chicago so far. The presentation was beautiful. The dishes were perfect to canvas all of the food. Major attention to detail. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable of the fish and very informative with the specials. Nice touch with the photos of the items on the phone. For what you get, I was impressed with the price. Raisu definitely has a great opportunity to be a long time staple on Irving Park. This place will definitely be hurting the other sushi restaurants in the area.

We stopped in for the first time Wed night and had a wonderful experience! Our server was thorough as she went over the menu and told us that Wednesday was the day that fresh fish was flown in from Japan. You could taste the difference immediately! The Toro flight was amazing and we did the Amberjack plate which was fresh and tasty! Everything was beautifully presented and staff was very friendly. We brought our 1 year old and felt very comfortable having him with us. Definitely check this neighborhood gem out, especially on Wed for freshest fish. As a note, this place is for those who truly enjoy sushi and look for fresh ingredients. The flavors are best as prepared with very little soy (if any). Kudos to the chef!

First of all, bring a hefty amount of cash with you as this place ain't cheap. The sushi is good, don't get me wrong, but for the prices they're charging it should be more plentiful AND better than it is. I'm guessing their sushi chef doesn't come cheap which would explain the high prices on the menu. Saki bottles start, yes start, at $45.00 and head north from there. We dropped $60 a person and we didn't go nuts. Meh - is what I say.

Did the omakase and loved it. Sat at the sushi bar so we chatted with chef Simon as he served us beautiful pieces of fish. If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd dine here once a week!!! The freshness of the fish is worth every penny. I hope this place sticks around because it's hard to find a great omakase place in Chicago at a reasonable price.

First feeling the otoro melting in your mouth like floating in heaven, then have the apple slices on side( it is not just for  garnishing) now have your drink, you will literally got the taste of The Garden of Eden!  The sweet shrimp nigiri is my must have every time. Wrapping up the  day with some Japanese whisky is a plus plus! Best birthday ever!

Yas!  Dined here last night because 1. we had a babysitter (aka grandparents), 2. husband wanted otoro, 3. we wanted somewhere close to home, 4. we wanted a fancy-ish meal but also didn't want to dress up.  This place pretty much fulfilled all of that!  To start, we had the Tuna Tartare and House Special Seafood Soup - yum and yum.  I ordered 3 of the special nigiri - Hon Maguro (bluefin tuna), Hamachi (yellowtail), and Jumbo Botan Ebi (sweet shrimp).  ALL of these were delicious, but the shrimp and the bluefin were my favorites!  I should've ordered another shrimp.  Husband ordered a flight of Otoro nigiri, which had 3 pieces...and then proceeded to order a 2nd flight of the same.  So....he liked it. Clearly.  We also ordered a spicy tuna roll, which we should've skipped and should've ordered more special nigiri instead.  A bit on the pricier side, but worth it for the quality.  Wish the drink choices were better, but the sushi is what we came for. :)

This new spot has the best sushi in the city. I have been all over to a lot of places;buffets, all-u-can-eat, conveyor belt, all kinds. This spot has the freshest I have ever had since Hotel Nikko Chicago was here. There is a reason that there is no soy sauce on the table. The sushi is so full of flavor, soy sauce would only hurt the flavor. The experence is not inexpensive. It is worth every penny. If you have a chance, go. Spend the money and experience what a sushi restaurant should be. Bring me the oysters, the sea urchin, the abalone, and the sea cucumbers. This is the kind if place that will bring a sushi fan into g h e unknown for a new experience.  Get it before it's gone. 115.00 for myself with one 16 dollar sake. The flavor is outstanding and the rolls are fat. Worth the price. The grenades are superb !

My first time eating here and so glad I finally was able to. The freshest fish I've had in Chicago so far. The presentation was beautiful. The dishes were perfect to canvas all of the food. Major attention to detail. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable of the fish and very informative with the specials. Nice touch with the photos of the items on the phone. For what you get, I was impressed with the price. Raisu definitely has a great opportunity to be a long time staple on Irving Park. This place will definitely be hurting the other sushi restaurants in the area.

We stopped in for the first time Wed night and had a wonderful experience! Our server was thorough as she went over the menu and told us that Wednesday was the day that fresh fish was flown in from Japan. You could taste the difference immediately! The Toro flight was amazing and we did the Amberjack plate which was fresh and tasty! Everything was beautifully presented and staff was very friendly. We brought our 1 year old and felt very comfortable having him with us. Definitely check this neighborhood gem out, especially on Wed for freshest fish. As a note, this place is for those who truly enjoy sushi and look for fresh ingredients. The flavors are best as prepared with very little soy (if any). Kudos to the chef!

First of all, bring a hefty amount of cash with you as this place ain't cheap. The sushi is good, don't get me wrong, but for the prices they're charging it should be more plentiful AND better than it is. I'm guessing their sushi chef doesn't come cheap which would explain the high prices on the menu. Saki bottles start, yes start, at $45.00 and head north from there. We dropped $60 a person and we didn't go nuts. Meh - is what I say.

Did the omakase and loved it. Sat at the sushi bar so we chatted with chef Simon as he served us beautiful pieces of fish. If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd dine here once a week!!! The freshness of the fish is worth every penny. I hope this place sticks around because it's hard to find a great omakase place in Chicago at a reasonable price.

Came here on a Sunday afternoon after exploring local eats on yelp. Immediately had a positive vibe from entering the restaurant. Simon our server did a fantastic job of introducing items on the menu. After deciding on a couple of items I was blown away by the taste. Spider Appetizer to start, Raisu's  House U-Don Noodles for me, Sake (Salmon) and Hon Maguro (Bluefin Tuna) for him. All were flavored well and balanced with there own twists such as fruit, pepper, savory and sweet. Highly recommend to anyone!

This was the first time my husband and I came here. It was phenomenal. We eat a lot of sushi (from a lot of different places) and this was the freshest and most thoughtfully prepared sushi we had ever had. Our server, YC, was so knowledgeable and sweet I could help but love her to pieces. We had a little bit of everything on the menu:
Spider App
Seafood Soup
Edamame (complimentary)

Super fresh and delicious sushi. Came here with a friend and we loved the restaurant, especially the signature nigiri and sashimi plates. Both of us are still talking about how delicious it was. The toro trio was amazing, as was the shiro maguro signature nigiri. Highly recommend trying many of their specialty nigiri pieces. My only slight complaint was a relatively high corkage fee ($15) but other than that everything was top notch. I will definitely return.

Amazing traditional sushi. Everything was excellent - everything! The scallop, salmon belly, madai, squid, amber jack, and tuna flight in particular were great and the chef's signature sushi was also amazing - adding wonderful surprises to already amazing dishes. We sat at the sushi bar and the owners chatted with us all night, gave us complementary sushi and created wonderful things for us.  And we got to see them make insanely creative dishes. This made for a fantastic date night. Will definitely be back!

My boyfriend and I went back to Raisu this past weekend and did indeed ask for Jack. We were offered 50% omakase (chef's choice) and 30% off regular menu items. This was exceedingly generous and I'm grateful for that.

We both decided to get the omakase. The first dish had gorgeous presentation coupled with delicious fish. It was a local fish from a small village in Japan from what we were told. The fish's head was on one side and there was a bed of ice in the middle where the sushi was and a tail coming out of the other side. Truly fantastic presentation and the fish was super fresh and delicious.

We were expecting superior presentation after this first dish, but all of the others were unextraordinary. They were not bad, per se, but expectations were so high after the first dish came out.

We had the following fish for our other courses: 2x hamachi (the waitress asked me what fish I liked and I told her this one and the chef was kind enough to give me this fish prepared 2 separate ways), black cod, salmon roe. 

The first hamachi dish was surprisingly delicious and had grapefruit paired with the fish. I'm not usually a fan of grapefruit, but the amount of bitterness was just right without being overpowering. My one gripe was that the fish needed to just be a bit colder to strengthen the already refreshing taste. 

Next came the salmon roe. I was a bit intimidated by this since I'm not a fan of roe in general. However, this roe was prepared differently and marinated over night in a sauce that removes more of the fishy aftertaste. It was a nice play on roe, but still a miss for me since I still had that unpleasant fishy aftertaste. Boyfriend liked it though.

Then came the black cod. This was the most disappointing course of the night. The black cod was paired with figs and the figs completely overpowered the cod. Interesting pairing, but just way too sweet. We informed the waitress - who was very attentive and sweet - that this was a bit of a miss for us, but that we loved the hamachi.

More hamachi came out and this had a nice spicy sauce. It was good, but not as inventive as the hamachi/grapefruit pairing from earlier.

I also got a miso soup (which was fantastic) and my boyfriend got a fish soup which he also loved. 

The omakase was $50/person normally and I honestly wouldn't want to pay that much for what we got. It just wasn't enough food to justify paying 50 bucks for it.

Overall, I was impressed by some, but not all, of the sushi pairings. The fish was reasonably fresh,  but Naoki is much better. 

I will probably come back to try some of their cheaper alternatives and they are a nice addition to the neighborhood, although they may have trouble surviving here.

Fish is flown in fresh from Japan and has a noticeable quality difference than your average Sushi spot.
I sat at the Sushi bar and things are done more traditionally where it is best if you consume the Nigiri as soon as it is served with your hands.
I had an off menu special Uni which was probably the best I've had.

Some little details that you typically don't see:
The nori is lightly smoked
The sushi rice was near body temperature providing an excellent platform for the fish
The wide selection of Japanese whiskey's was a nice touch.

All in all, if you've watched a documentary like Jiro dreams of sushi, this is probably as close as you'll get to that in Irving Park.

We decided to try out this new Japenese resturant in our neighborhood today. Wow! We are so glad that we decided to check this place out! We sat at the bar in front of the head sushi chef Simon. He was extremely informative and sociable. He even gave each of us complementary salad. It was cucumber salad taken up 100 notches, as was everything else served to us during this visit. The nigiri is to die for, the fish melts in your mouth. This place has literally jaded me. I have never tasted fish this fresh. I almost feel disgusted about some of the other sushi I have eaten. If you are a sushi lover check this place out and if you are not a sushi lover check this place out, you will become a sushi lover here.

I tried Raisu again even though I had a terrible first experience because the manager informed me that the rude waitress had been fired and explained they are working on the kinks. To be completely honest, Raisu most definitely was the best sushi I have ever had. Hands down. I would go down the menu to list my favorites but it's just not possible because everything truly is so good. I admit the prices are a bit higher than some other places but it was very much worth it. My fiance and I actually realized it is very reminiscent of Momotaro........but better. The owner?/manager? Jack truly is a visionary and I'm so glad that I am able to re-write this review. I was actually really worried that I would never be able to go back there because I was so traumatized the first time even though the food was amazing. There is really nothing more I can say other than if you truly love sushi, you should come here. It is an amazing experience but make sure you don't go there for a quick bite. This will take a bit longer because of the experience they try to create. My recommendations are to go on off hours, make a reservation, don't be in a hurry (don't make plans for afterwards), and try everything. You really won't regret it.

Although on the pricer side, it was worth the experience. Sushi was fresh and the rice was soft. Staff members were experts on the items on the menu and really understood the ingredients that are part of each dish, including where the fish came from--really impressed.

The service was great, and the place looks beautiful.  Great ambience, and overall a great addition to the community!  We will be back multiple times.

Came here tonight to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and could not be happier! The food was outstanding! Based on a prior review I went for the $75 omakase as well as an app or two and was absolutely stuffed! Everything was fresh and delicious. I'm not sure who wrote the "one star" reviews but the staff could not have been more pleasant or accommodating. Everyone from the servers to the sushi chef took great pride in the restaurant and offerings. I can't wait to go again! Side note the toro which was a special was heavenly!

We had the best date night here. The staff and manager were so pleasant and helpful in selecting dishes to try.

The ambiance was lovely, and we felt very welcome (we stayed for 3 hours)!

This fish was amazing. From the presentation to the taste, everything was on point. We're so excited to have this place in our neighborhood!

After my trip to Japan, I couldn't find good quality sushi back to Chicago.  Thankfully, I found this new sushi spot that only serves fresh sashimi grade fish. It is hard to find in Chicago and today, they have limited fresh Uni all the way from Hokkaido, Japan.  This place is a gem!!!

The specialty is the sushi.  I've not been to a place in Chicago that serves nigiri with warm rice out of the rice cooker with a fresh piece of fish like they do (e.g. Sushi Sasabune in L.A.).  All of the specialty sashimi or nigiri is served with a unique condiment on top, and was matched well.

My favorite was the uni nigiri served with a quail egg.

We had a great meal here! I am very picky about my sushi and was so impressed by the quality and freshness of the  fish.  Service was friendly and attentive, and the decor is very pleasant. They tend to over-complicate some of the dishes by adding Western toppings, but I asked for everything the traditional way (e.g. No banana in my seaweed salad, no apple butter on our salmon nigiri) and it was very simple and delicious.

GRAND OPENING 8/18/17 - Very Excited! Hands down best sushi, extremely fresh, high end, great service, friendly people, you need to experience a Raisu evening!

My first appraisal of Raisu was "thank god Irving Park finally got a decent sushi spot." Now that I've eaten there twice, I've updated that to "Irving Park now has one of the best sushi restaurants in Chicago." I can't wait to go back.

Here's the most important thing to keep in mind before you head to Raisu: nigiri/sashimi is Chef Simon's thing--not maki. He'll tell you so himself. If you focus on nigiri/sashimi, you will have an elevated experience. The maki, though fresh and tasty, are just not where it's really at. 

I came here first with friends and kids the night of the grand opening, and tasted enough notable deliciousness amidst the child-induced chaos of our party to return the next night for a quieter meal at the bar and to try the omakase. It turned out to be one of the most memorable sushi meals I've ever had. 

The meal started off with a small sashimi salad (kind of palate cleanser-ish), followed by a delicious lobster/sweet potato soup with crab. Then came the scallop sashimi...wow. The freshness of the scallops, the thoughtfulness of the roasted garlic puree and other toppings, which perfectly complimented the sweetness of the scallops without overwhelming them--it was possibly my favorite dish of the evening, which is saying a lot. This was followed by the ikura (salmon roe) sashimi style, which others have written and raved about justifiably (imagine salmon roe without overbearing saltiness nor fishiness, just fresh little pops of delight that melt away). 

Then came the parade of nigiri. Each plate had one nigiri prepared traditionally, and then the same fish prepared in Chef Simon's signature style. Salmon, hamachi, suzuki, white tuna, shrimp, maybe others. Now, I love nigiri with toppings, but I have to admit that more often than not, the toppings, however delicious, steal the show, and you can't truly enjoy the fish. Not at Raisu. Each signature nigiri added subtle (and at times unexpected) flavors that still let the beautiful and fresh cuts of fish shine through. Butter-braised apple and black pepper with the salmon, for example--not what you'd expect, but believe me, it works. (Even if you opt not for the omakase, I would still recommend ordering traditional and signature nigiri side-by-side. Both will be delicious, and each informs the other.) The shrimp nigiri, though, was something else--kurama-ebi I believe it was. Wow. I've never had shrimp like that. Barely cooked with a blowtorch, it was firm yet tender with a delicate and wonderful flavor. 

Finally, I had the uni nigiri, which was paired with a quail egg yolk and a few salmon roe. I've never appreciated uni before, but I do now.

Bottom line: go. It's so good.

I've been to a lot of sushi restaurants and this by far the best one I've eaten at. They have both traditional nigiri and their own unique spin on things, their signature nigiri. Both of which are amazing. Plus their signature nigiri barely costs anymore so if you're looking for a new experience, definitely try their signature nigiri. It adds some great flavours that compliment the flavours you're used to already. In fact, you might not even recognise some of the flavours from your favourite fishes. Their fish is imported straight from Japan and is so fresh you probably won't even recognise some of your usual favourites. The staff is also incredibly friendly and helpful it makes you feel like you're talking to a sushi expert. The manager Jack (if you see him around the guy with the red glasses) will be able to answer any questions you have. And if you have the opportunity to sit at the sushi bar, which you definitely should, Simon, the sushi chef, is incredibly entertaining and knowledgeable about anything you might order or want. Both fantastic and friendly guys. Love this restaurant! If you're looking for one of the best sushi experiences in your life definitely come here.

Umai was my first Japanese restaurant I've visited when I moved to Chicago (2.5 years ago!) but it's also my favourite Japanese/sushi restaurant in all of Chicago. Service is great, the vibes are relaxed/chill, the food here is consistently good and the sushi/fish here is fresh.

I would highly recommend ordering an udon and half order of the Chicago Roll - my two favourites! Honestly, I feel like the half order of Chicago Roll is the perfect portion in comparison to the regular order (isn't it awesome that Umai does half orders? Prices are just half the price).

I ordered the chirashi the first time I came here, it was good but a little pricier than other places but the quality is there. Wouldn't recommend ordering it if you are hungry!

My most recent visit, I tried the omakase. It's pretty good! It's not the same as the table side fancy omakase places where you eat the sushi and the chef makes it but it's very good. Fish is fresh and you get a great variety.

It gets pretty busy here too, so I would recommend making reservations. Bonus tip: They are on Seated! If you have a party 4 or less, use Seated to make reservations so then you can get some starbucks/amazon gift cards!

Came here w a small group of friends. None of us were impressed. Ordered a a few things to try. We were all suprised with our experience, because the place was packed and they have great reviews.
Food: edamame 2 (overcooked and lost its crunch), gyoza 2 (cold inside and over burnt outside). On to the ramen: I thought this place was known for their ramen?!?! What is up w just serving half an egg, other places give you an entire molten egg. My Tonkotsu broth was not as flavorful as the Spicy Garlic. The miso ramen was just too salty. We informed our server of these complaints, but nothing was addressed. We left most of the food and did not pack to take home.
Service: 2
Ambience: 4
Cleanliness: 4
Maybe multiple staff in training or the kitchen staff was having a really really off day.

Okay, LET ME TELL YOU. When I walked in, immediately, the sugary chic interior design got my appetite going.

We tried Umai on a Wednesday night around 7, and thank goodness we made a reservation because the place was bustling! The service was top notch even though the restaurant was spilling with business. Relative to the sheer number of people resent, the piping hot meals arrived at rapid speed (and on charming plates too!)

Our table ordered the katsu kare, spicy roasted garlic pork ramen, and tuna roll. The katsu kare curry had a smoother/lighter texture and didn't feel too dense, which I personally enjoyed. The fried pork cutlet bursted in flavor at the perfect level of crispiness. 

The ramen and sushi were also supposedly delicious! 

Just a sidenote: the napkin quality was A+, and that's how you know a restaurant is on its game.

Tips: make a reservation! Try the katsu kare! Enjoy the interior design!

Chicago Roll (5/5) - It's almost as if this roll is tailored for my tastes. Tuna, salmon, avocado, black tobiko, honey miso all garnished with this crunchy element that I'm not sure what it is but it's commonly used in sushi rolls. The honey miso wasn't too strong and overpowering, and the crunchy thing really rounded out the flavor and texture profile of the roll. You also get the fresh salmon and tuna. It does seem like there is a little too much going on and I wish it were prepared a big smaller so you don't have to take multiple bites to eat each piece, but it's a solid roll. Chicago Roll better than California Roll anyday (obviously).

White truffle tails (3.5/5) - Decent roll but it's a bit bland. The asparagus was a nice touch to add some texture to each roll. You do get a bit of the truffle taste but it's very subtle. This roll could use a bit more flavor but overall not bad

A delightful find! Really enjoyed our time here. 

Located on a random average street, Umai looks unassuming from the outside but it's very trendy, clean, and surprisingly spacious inside. We went on a Saturday night with no reservation and waited for only 15 min, so not too bad. We actually meant to get deep dish pizza since we just got back from Japan the day before, but the line was too long there and that's how we ended up at Umai - obviously not with very high expectations because, well, we were eating Japanese food IN Japan less than 48 hours ago.

We were pleasantly surprised! The agedashi tofu appetizer has a surprisingly generous portion, and the light soy sauce broth, slightly glutinous layer and the silky tofu underneath is a delicious combination. The nabeyaki udon is sizable, and maintains a delicate balance of tastiness while being light and clean. The fish on the rolls we got were fresh and satisfying, and at reasonable price points! Experience-wise, the servers are quick and attentive even though the restaurant was full. The restaurant never got too loud and rowdy while we were there (a relief for 2 jet lagged travelers), and the music was always at an audible but bearable level (aka low enough to talk to the people you're eating without raising your voice). 

It was a pleasant and enjoyable dining experience, would definitely recommend it!

Amazing dinner at this downtown gem. We sat at the bar and got to watch the chefs work their magic. 

The spicy tuna is sooo flavorful! One of the best I've had. Wasn't a huge fan of the Goosebumps roll but it was still okay. The calamari presentation was beautiful but I didn't like the texture. 

The salmon quality was on point. Mouth watering delicious. Definitely ordering more salmon next time!

Our waitress was a doll. Very friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. Recommended a great cold sake which complimented the food perfectly. We'll be back next time we're in town!

Came for the sukiyaki and we left with bellies full of winter ramen, Chicago rolls, and hot sake. Definitely worth the visit.

The sukiyaki ($18) looks HUGE but I do wish the hotpot was a little deeper, with a bit more broth and more tofu, but over all it was exactly what I was looking for. The perfect sweetness. The winter ramen has a fish based broth and was light yet savory. Not overall fishy at all. The Chicago roll was delicious, but we ate it so fast I can't actually give you a solid description... 

The only downside to our visit was that we had a reservation and unfortunately had to wait and then sit at the bar. The hostess was apologetic and the view of the chefs making the delicious rolls was actually a treat.

Would definitely go back and maybe try more sushi options!

Wasn't sure what to expect from this place. It could easily have turned out to be a California roll / average sushi joint, but very happy that instead it was more of an izakaya style place with an extremely extensive menu that covers everything from hot and cold appetizers to ramen to mini omakase options. My friend and I opted to share the black garlic tonkotsu ramen (house signature item), omakase sushi and a small bottle of sake. The ramen was divine and I really appreciated that the server split the large bowl into two small bowls for us so that we each got the full experience. Thought there was a tad bit too much black garlic, but a small problem to have. The sushi was very fresh and I liked the variety. Service is quick, efficient and friendly. Overall I am very impressed by this unassuming place! It's not purist or super traditional, but it's definitely a solid option if you're looking for good quality staple Japanese options.

We were able to secure a table without reservations on a Saturday evening around 7:00pm, and I believe it was the last table for two.

The restaurant isn't too big or small and has various 2- to 4-seat tables. There is one long group table made for about 10 people. When you first walk into the restaurant, the host stand is situated on the left, sushi bar is in front of you, and dining area is to the right. It would be great to sit at the sushi bar where you get to interact with the sushi chefs. However, we got seated by the window. It's a trendy, moderately-dark atmosphere and is a great group spot or date spot in the evening.

We ordered the Hamachi Kama for our appetizer, which honestly looks like a bread/pastry upon first glance. After a good long look at it, I dug in and enjoyed it. It had a crispy skin and moist interior. It complemented the dipping sauce very well. For the entree, I ordered the Ton Katsu Ramen. It comes with wakame seaweed, corn, fish cake, half boiled egg, japanese leeks, mushroom, menma (bamboo), chashu (braised pork belly). I tried it with the black oil, which did enhance the flavor a bit. It's a good bowl of ramen, but I wouldn't say it's the best in Chicago. For dessert, we ordered the black sesame ice cream. I've come to love this type of ice cream, and it was decent here. The best one I've had is at Ramen-San. This one does have a similar taste to vanilla ice cream with a hint of sesame.

The service was good, and our server wasn't overbearing. We had our water cups refilled promptly.

This is one of those restaurants where you should try it at least once.

The bf and I was craving sushi so we decided at the last minute to stop in for din. It's been a while since we've gotten food here and I actually just noticed looking back on my previous review that we ended up ordering the same exact items, which I think is hilarious because they have such an extensive menu. But I guess we like what we like, right? Will have to make a mental note to myself to try something new the next time we're in.

Anyways, all the rolls hit the spot. We got the fresh philly, spicy tuna, unagi avo crunchy, and a half portion of the Chicago. And of course, we got the spicy roasted garlic pork ramen that everyone raves about. The broth was delicious, it had a nice strong garlic flavor and the noodles were perfectly cook. However, I didn't find it very spicy but it was still delicious. The waitress was kind enough to offer splitting the order into to separate bowls, which was greatly appreciated so we didn't have to awkwardly share a bowl of noodle between the two of us.

So if you're ever in the South Loop area, Umai gets the job done. Lots of options at a fair price. They deliver as well!

Umai has a pretty extensive menu with a variety of options from sushi, to ramen, or rice dishes. Don't overlook their hot/cold appetizers either - a couple people in our party were Umai regulars and ordered a great selection to start the meal off!

Agedashi Tofu - Tofu was crispy on the outside but super soft inside. The sauce was sweet and vinegar-y, but not overpowering. Mushrooms were a nice compliment to the tofu. 

Hamachi Kama (not pictured, but highly recommended) - This is a yellowtail collar that is grilled to leave a very cripsy exterior/skin, but the interior is juicy with almost a gelatinous texture to it. Very yummy.

Kaki Fried (not pictured) -  The fried oysters here have a thicker breading in comparison to other restaurants I've ordered this dish from. Served with a plum sauce that was OK. I prefer this dish with spicy mayo.

Spicy Roasted Garlic Pork Ramen - Very generous portion! The broth had the strong garlic flavor we wanted but could've been spicier. The pork had a nice marbel of fat and meat and the noodles were perfectly cooked. 

Mexicana Roll - Great roll! Umai has a perfect ratio of rice to fish (less rice, more fish), which I appreciated. Tune and salmon were very fresh! Can't go wrong with this roll!

Spicy Tuna - I really liked the spicy (sriracha and chili oil) blend that have with the tuna! Yum!

Great sushi! I've never eaten at the restaurant but we've ordered delivery twice now. (They take about 45 min, pretty standard.)

Things we've tried:
Sushi platter - good assortment, all the fish was fresh, nothing too exciting
Spicy tuna roll - tasty but overwhelmingly spicy IMO because they use chili oil I believe... although I'm kind of a pansy.
Yellowtail roll - this one tasted ever-so-slightly off to me, or just not very flavorful.
Scallop nigiri - standard, good!

The miso soup is nice and light with plenty of seaweed, scallions, and tofu.
The salad is not traditional, i.e., there were tomatoes and green beans if I recall correctly, and the dressing was thicker than other places--but delicious! I liked the uniqueness.

Had the ramen crave.  Umai = Ramen cure

I've only ever been here for the ramen, but they have a decent sized menu.  This time when I looked thru the menu, I was really attracted to the udon and the curry rice.  But...I had the kiddies in tow and they are voracious noodle eaters, and can't handle their spice yet, so I'd rather more options for them than satisfying my quest for curry.  

I made a reservation for 8 with two high chairs for 5pm.  The table was set already when we arrived - just be aware that they only have one high chair and one booster seat.  We didn't want to tie up their premier table in the middle of the restaurant, asked if we could have the end of the booth seating instead - which they accommodated easily.   They had sidewalk Al fresco dining area as well, but we opted for the a/c on a summer evening.  The staff was very friendly, helpful, and proactively addressed our queries.  

Once we sat, they pour out waters for us as it was a warm day. 

I kind of wished I had a photo menu just to see some of the works of art that the kitchen kicks out, it is a Japanese restaurant...but to Yelp I go!  

We had the dipping ramen and the tonkatsu.  The noodles are different for each ramen that we ordered.  The dipping ramen was thicker, more typical and what I enjoy when eating ramen.  But the tonkatsu used a thinner noodle which was good in its own right, just a matter of my own preference of texture.  

The dipping ramen was served dry with all the toppings with a side of spicy soup (it was almost as spicy as kimchee ji-gae).  After tasting the broth compared to the tonkatsu, the spicy soup was saltier.  

I enjoyed the tonkatsu ramen.  The soft egg was luxurious.  Nicely soft cooked egg, I think it was marinated - as the outer white was a soft caramel colour.  I could just appreciate that.  Bamboo and woodear added some really good texture and crunch.  Make sure your tonkatsu has green onions, because that added a good amount of flavor.  The char-siu had good balance and nicely seasoned.  (It also garnered a second portion request or my picky eater).  

All together, a good experience.  I'll definitely need to try the Kare next time.  The staff is pleasant, the food has been consistent from when I last hopped in for ramen.  The space is lovely and spacious enough where you don't need to listen in on the next tables conversation.  It's the neighborhood Japanese restaurant.

I have one word for this restaurant: wow!

Umai isn't a big place so I would recommend making reservations. Even with reservations we still had to wait 10-20 minutes. The interior was nice - I really liked the ambiance.

The menu has a good selection. My friend's ended up ordering ramen and I got the soba with sashimi. One of my friends who visits regularly also got some of the Uni Nigiri and says it's delicious! She gets it every time.

I was really impressed with my food - for $19 I got a generous portion of soba and they didn't skimp on the sashimi. The best part? The quality of the fish! I love sushi and sashimi and I have to say that the quality here is amazing. The fish is fresh and it melts in your mouth! No tough, chewy pieces here. The soba came with a little fresh seaweed and some tempura pieces; it was unique and gave the noodles a nice flavor and the tempura gave it texture which I really enjoyed. 

The service here was great as well. I love restaurants where the server is around when you need them, but they don't interrupt your meal or the conversation too much. They were attentive in filling up our waters, and were good about splitting the bill by order.

Overall I was really impressed with Umai. I will be bringing friends back with me! Definitely give Umai a try fellow sushi lovers :)

Wow. The sashimi and maki was all SO fresh. It would just melt in your mouth. Ambiance was perfect, and wait-staff was incredibly nice. It was the perfect start to a Friday evening which ended with a beautiful ballet! Can't wait to go back!

We had the Chicago and Mexicana maki rolls (so glad they offered half rolls!) and 4 types of sashimi

Came for an early dinner/late lunch. We ordered two omakase (chef's choice): one sushi and one sashimi. Each came with 10pieces + miso soup + salad. The salad was simple: one slice of tomato and mostly iceberg lettuce. Miso soup was nice and hot. The sushi was generous and well prepared - ten different types of fish with a small amount of rice and wasabi already added between fish and rice. The waitress asked if we had questions - I completely forgot what fish she told me we were having though haha. The sushi also included two pieces of tamago. The sashimi was 2 slices each of five different fishes, also thick, generous pieces.

As for the taste, the wasabi was not very spicy (not sure what this means but just has to use more wasabi than usual). Some of the fish types were a bit too fishy for me - had to drown in soy sauce to mask the fishiness. The tamago was extremely sweet and was cold. Besides those, the rest of the fish was very nice.

Overall it came to ~$60 (not including tax). In terms of portion I would give a 5 star but I'm giving a 4 star because of the taste.

This place is beyond amazing. It must be a popular restaurant because they hardly had any availability but managed to squeeze us in. The Lychee Martini was made just right. I got the Umai Crunchy roll and Gyoza. Both tasted so pure and clean with natural flavors and didn't have any signs of typical Asian fast food ingredients or additives. The Pork Katsu was my dinner and it was also delicious. They put a lot of sauce on it but I know to ask for it in the side next time. All in all the service was amazing and the food was outstanding!!!

This was my second time here and it was very pleasant! First time we went during dinner and it was very packed we got udon noodles, edamame, Chicago sushi roll, and green tea creme brle. Everything was delicious and on point. Today we went for lunch and I got the lunch special sukiyaki. The portion was huge and the flavors were great! My friend thought her scallop roll was a little small for $8 but overall everything was delicious! Would definitely be back again!

Got th Gyu-Don and shared the Surf & Turf and the Chicago Roll.

The Gyu-Don had so much meat on it! I was so impressed. I'm glad that they seasoned the rice so it was just plain ol' rice. The Gyu-Don came with a side salad and udon. The udon was nice comforting side to the Gyu-don. The Chicago roll was meh and kinda underwhelming. But the Surf & Turf was amazing. The beef on top really put the entire roll together. Also, I loved that they put apple in the Surf & Turf. I would say apple is an underrated fruit that goes great in savory dishes.

I've gotten the ramen here and it's also amazing. My friends got the Witner Ramen and they could not stop raving about it. 

I would recommend doing a reservation as it can get crowded during meal times.

Umai has a pretty extensive menu with a variety of options from sushi, to ramen, or rice dishes. Don't overlook their hot/cold appetizers either - a couple people in our party were Umai regulars and ordered a great selection to start the meal off!

Agedashi Tofu - Tofu was crispy on the outside but super soft inside. The sauce was sweet and vinegar-y, but not overpowering. Mushrooms were a nice compliment to the tofu. 

Hamachi Kama (not pictured, but highly recommended) - This is a yellowtail collar that is grilled to leave a very cripsy exterior/skin, but the interior is juicy with almost a gelatinous texture to it. Very yummy.

Kaki Fried (not pictured) -  The fried oysters here have a thicker breading in comparison to other restaurants I've ordered this dish from. Served with a plum sauce that was OK. I prefer this dish with spicy mayo.

Spicy Roasted Garlic Pork Ramen - Very generous portion! The broth had the strong garlic flavor we wanted but could've been spicier. The pork had a nice marbel of fat and meat and the noodles were perfectly cooked. 

Mexicana Roll - Great roll! Umai has a perfect ratio of rice to fish (less rice, more fish), which I appreciated. Tune and salmon were very fresh! Can't go wrong with this roll!

Spicy Tuna - I really liked the spicy (sriracha and chili oil) blend that have with the tuna! Yum!

Great sushi! I've never eaten at the restaurant but we've ordered delivery twice now. (They take about 45 min, pretty standard.)

Things we've tried:
Sushi platter - good assortment, all the fish was fresh, nothing too exciting
Spicy tuna roll - tasty but overwhelmingly spicy IMO because they use chili oil I believe... although I'm kind of a pansy.
Yellowtail roll - this one tasted ever-so-slightly off to me, or just not very flavorful.
Scallop nigiri - standard, good!

The miso soup is nice and light with plenty of seaweed, scallions, and tofu.
The salad is not traditional, i.e., there were tomatoes and green beans if I recall correctly, and the dressing was thicker than other places--but delicious! I liked the uniqueness.

Had the ramen crave.  Umai = Ramen cure

I've only ever been here for the ramen, but they have a decent sized menu.  This time when I looked thru the menu, I was really attracted to the udon and the curry rice.  But...I had the kiddies in tow and they are voracious noodle eaters, and can't handle their spice yet, so I'd rather more options for them than satisfying my quest for curry.  

I made a reservation for 8 with two high chairs for 5pm.  The table was set already when we arrived - just be aware that they only have one high chair and one booster seat.  We didn't want to tie up their premier table in the middle of the restaurant, asked if we could have the end of the booth seating instead - which they accommodated easily.

This place is one of the best authentic Japanese food restaurant in the states. I went there alone which was a terrible mistake since they had so many menus I that wanted to try out. Kat su don, sa ke don, advocado&salmon rolls, ramen...all my favorites...
I chose sa ke don which is a bowl of rice with fresh salmon on top along with a tb of wasabi, ginger and radish. It was actually as good as the one I tried in Japan! It would've been tastier if the rice was seasoned as they used plain white rice whereas the other sa ke dons I tried had seasoned rice. However the salmon was amazingly fresh and thick! And it was also aesthetically pleasing which I haven't expected at all. A little over priced but still worth it.

Umai offers a wide range of Japanese dishes and sushi. I got their tonkotsu ramen on a cold winter evening, and the soup warmed my soul. The broth was rich and flavorful, the chashu was tender and juicy, the noodles were cooked al dente, and the egg was boiled to perfection, not too runny and not fully cooked. This is a solid place for ramen, and I will definitely be back to try out their other dishes.

Disappointing ramen, OK service.

I ordered the tonkotsu ramen. The broth tasted OK / kind of funny, and the pork was dry / firm. I like it when it's soft / practically falling apart.  

My g/f got katsu (pork cutlets), and I thought that was dry and chewy. 

Prices were $13-ish for a bowl, which actually is probably on lower end for ramen near downtown.  Serving size was decent.

Service was OK / average.

Just OK. The restaurant was finishing up lunch service so we were warned when we sat down. Standard Sushi + Izakaya fare. Everyone was served a bowl of miso to start - even the person having udon. The udon was the same you would get anywhere. Sysco must have a prepared udon they offer. I had an over cooked and under seasoned (sea salt) salmon shioyaki served oddly enough with broccoli and potatoes. Sashimi seemed fine. It's not a destination.

Holy mother of all ramen.

After being on Yelp almost every day for the past 4 years, you learn a lot about people's foodie opinions. And one thing I've learned is people are extra picky when it comes to which ramen is "authentic," "real," or "tastes how ramen should." Now, I've had ramen a few times, not counting instant packets at home, and have never been super impressed. Yeah, it's yummy and all the extra stuff they put in it is fun but nothing that makes me want to get it again...until now. What I'm trying to tell you is I get it. 

Umai's ramen is amazing. I now know what "great" ramen tastes like. Full disclosure, I ordered the gyu don and ate a ton of my wife's winter ramen and friend's Spicy Roasted Garlic Pork ramen. The Gyu Don was fantastic but not as unique and flavorful as the ramens. My favorite was probably the Spicy Roasted Garlic Pork but they both were great. I was shocked you could get that much flavor in there. 

Apart from the amazing food, the service and atmosphere was great. It's cozy but not crowded and that staff were helpful when ordering and friendly. I highly recommend checking out Umai if you're trying to find some awesome ramen.

Tried to go here tonight, we put our names down and were told it would be a half hour wait. Fast forward another hour and fifteen minutes and we still weren't seated. At that point, we just ate elsewhere. By the time we got our food at the next restaurant we went to, we finally received a text letting us know our table was ready, an hour and half had elapsed at that point. Just an all around horribly unorganized restaurant, do yourself a favor and don't waste your time here.

Visiting from SoCal. If you're looking to satiate your Japanese craving, look no further. 

Ramen (had the garlic pork), omakase, udon, and sukiyaki - all solid and you can't go wrong. 

I've had my share of Japanese food and would say this establishment nears the top of my list. 

Good for friends, a date, family, or if you're looking to just treat yourself.

Out of all the Japanese and Asian places in the Loop, this is my favorite. All the sashimis are extremely fresh (only sad they give you 2-3 pieces for $7-8) and this place was the first time I ever had sea urchin (you really must try it!!). 
Been here a couple times now with the BF and tried several things: the spicy pork ramen, the dipping noodles, the katsukare, the unagi roll with spicy mayo, and the salmon skin roll. They are all....amazing. 
The spicy pork ramen came in a HUGE bowl, enough to feed two people and was so saturated with umami it was almost too much for my senses to drink the soup straight. It was not spicy at all, however, but definitely was filled with flavor and ingredients - they definitely don't skimp here!
Dipping noodles were very meh, but that's probably because the soup you dipped it into was so strongly mushroomy. The katsukare ($12)... was amazing, and HUGE. Me and the BF had to share it since the plate literally covered up half the table. 

Basically, I'm going to keep coming back here over and over until I've tried their whole menu. This place is definitely worth a try, and definitely bring a friend to eat with you! If you want to have a super filling meal, I'd suggest ordering maybe 2 rolls (the spicy mayo unagi roll was heavenly, and only $7) and the katsukare ($13.5 with an extra poached egg).

No qualms about the price - all the noodles and entrees average $12-18 and they can easily feed two people and then some.

Wandered to the south loop location during a recent trip to Chicago. We chose Umai based on the pictures on Yelp. The photos made the atmosphere and food look fantastic. 

We were able to call ahead and reserve a table which was a good thing since it appeared to be pretty busy for a Monday night. It is located right next to a crossfit gym and we noticed several people in workout clothes. Cool, laid-back, casual vibe. But way more fancy than a hole in the wall sushi bar.

I had a spicy tuna roll and the Chicago roll. Both were fantastic. I started with clear soup and it was average, tasty, and not tooooo hot. Nothing worse than burning your tongue before eating sushi.

Overall I loved the atmosphere. It was very cool. Cute date night spot with dimmed lighting and prices weren't bad at all!

This was my first time going to Umai. I'm not going to lie the reviews almost scared me out of coming to this place. Prior to this, I had Umai on my list of places to check out (after being told this one of the best sushi spots in the south loop). Today I finally got to see what it's all about. I went at a good time because it was not crowded at all, so I got seated right away. The place has simple decor and the waiter/waitress was really friendly. 

While waiting for my party to arrive, I glanced over the menu.  There is so much to choose from it can be slightly overwhelming. I made the decision to get the Dragon Roll, Lychee Martini and Nabeyaki Udon. 

The Dragon Roll was really fresh.  I enjoyed the presentation as well 

Lychee Martini was decent but I've had stronger

The Nabeyaki Udon wasn't bad but it did lack flavor. I'm not sure if that is how it's supposed to taste but I just feel like that extra umph was missing. 

All in all, I had a good lunch. The portion size was good. I really could have skipped having the Nabeyaki Udon and stuck with the Roll paired with my drink. Although I enjoyed my meal , I'm not quite sure if I would return. I didn't order anything that was heart stopping or a must have. I'll have to get some recommendations and I might change my mind. Again not a terrible experience just not breathtaking

Umai is a-okay. We were looking for a restaurant last minute for a large group on a weekend night for dinner and Umai was one of the few options available with reservations. Our group ordered a variety of dishes ranging from salmon, spicy pork ramen, and omakase. The spicy pork ramen was too salty for me, but the portion size was extremely generous. It also cost $14, so there better be a good portion! Not too impressed by the ramen- there are definitely better places for ramen in Chicago! The sashimi was fresh but price is not the most reasonable. 

Overall, I was not impressed by Umai.

Every city I visit, I need at least one decent ramen meal. I tried this place with some coworkers hoping it would fit the bill. 

We seemed to arrive just at the right time. We were seated immediately for 6pm, but halfway through our meal there was already a line at the door. They had plenty of indoor and outdoor seating options and room for larger parties like ours. 

I ordered the Miso Ramen, but was a bit disappointed. It didn't have much miso flavor, instead it was more salty with some sesame seed to taste. The best part was probably the roasted-smoky flavored pork. I also tried a bite of the Spicy Roasted Garlic Pork Ramen, which had a more flavorful broth but still didn't hit the spot. Having tried more ramen then I can count, it's tough to compare expectations. 

Another friend ordered the Katsu Don and thoroughly enjoyed it. It looked and smelled delicious too if you want a good rice dish. They also offer other soup or rice dishes, so I would probably try another option next time.

I met a friend here, otherwise I wouldn't have gone down this particular corner of the Loop.    Great food, moderate prices; a lunch with a soda and large portion of a Pork disk (Katsu Don: no way one person could eat it all), also with small soup and salad, it came to about $24 with tip.   The service was fine and we were seated quickly by the window, its a relatively quiet area on the weekend.   Definitely recommended for their generous portions which tasted amazing!

Umai is an all-over decent place to eat, for both sushi and ramen. Would give it 3.5 stars.

My ideal noodle dish would be the noodles in their miso ramen put into the spicy garlic pork broth. The spicy roasted garlic pork ramen has amazing broth that is thick, creamy miso based, and not super spicy with toasted garlic. The noodles are a bit stringy and thin and not expected chewy that I'm accustomed to for ramen. The miso ramen broth is not very miso-y; in fact it's rather bland. However, the noodles are more of what I'd expect for ramen as they are thicker with a bit of bite and chew into the texture. Egg is yummy, the cha siu tastes a little off- more like pork shoulder than tender BBQ pork. 

Sushi is good. Nice chunks of fish in the simple rolls. Have also tried their Katsu curry which was tasty too. Katsu is actually quite well done - would give 4 stars. The curry is a bit on the mild side. Good place for convo and relaxing atmosphere.

If you like salmon. Get the sakedon. You will not regret. 
The location is kinda awkward and we were seated at an awkward table kinda in the middle of everything (felt like that table really shouldn't be there) but the sakedon just made me extremely happy. Try it!

Visiting from SoCal. If you're looking to satiate your Japanese craving, look no further. 

Ramen (had the garlic pork), omakase, udon, and sukiyaki - all solid and you can't go wrong. 

I've had my share of Japanese food and would say this establishment nears the top of my list. 

Good for friends, a date, family, or if you're looking to just treat yourself.

Out of all the Japanese and Asian places in the Loop, this is my favorite. All the sashimis are extremely fresh (only sad they give you 2-3 pieces for $7-8) and this place was the first time I ever had sea urchin (you really must try it!!). 
Been here a couple times now with the BF and tried several things: the spicy pork ramen, the dipping noodles, the katsukare, the unagi roll with spicy mayo, and the salmon skin roll. They are all....amazing. 
The spicy pork ramen came in a HUGE bowl, enough to feed two people and was so saturated with umami it was almost too much for my senses to drink the soup straight. It was not spicy at all, however, but definitely was filled with flavor and ingredients - they definitely don't skimp here!
Dipping noodles were very meh, but that's probably because the soup you dipped it into was so strongly mushroomy. The katsukare ($12)... was amazing, and HUGE. Me and the BF had to share it since the plate literally covered up half the table. 

Basically, I'm going to keep coming back here over and over until I've tried their whole menu. This place is definitely worth a try, and definitely bring a friend to eat with you! If you want to have a super filling meal, I'd suggest ordering maybe 2 rolls (the spicy mayo unagi roll was heavenly, and only $7) and the katsukare ($13.5 with an extra poached egg).

No qualms about the price - all the noodles and entrees average $12-18 and they can easily feed two people and then some.

Wandered to the south loop location during a recent trip to Chicago. We chose Umai based on the pictures on Yelp. The photos made the atmosphere and food look fantastic. 

We were able to call ahead and reserve a table which was a good thing since it appeared to be pretty busy for a Monday night. It is located right next to a crossfit gym and we noticed several people in workout clothes. Cool, laid-back, casual vibe. But way more fancy than a hole in the wall sushi bar.

I had a spicy tuna roll and the Chicago roll. Both were fantastic. I started with clear soup and it was average, tasty, and not tooooo hot. Nothing worse than burning your tongue before eating sushi.

Overall I loved the atmosphere. It was very cool. Cute date night spot with dimmed lighting and prices weren't bad at all!

I got the spicey pork, really good, not that spicey at all tho. Also the ground pork is minimum , you can pay extra for more. The noodles were tender and really good. The pork cutlets were amazing. Small place but super cute and romantic lighting. Good music playing. Not portion, I ordered sushi and couldn't finish it. The staff are on point as well. Super recommend!

There may be a wait, but it goes by quickly. What I like is, even though the service is fast, they don't make you feel rushed. I recommend anything and everything on their menu!

Had a Father and "Oldest Son" Night Out before a performance by the ever impressive Giordano Dance Company at the Auditorium.  We showed up at Umai (Traffic was good this night) 30 minutes early for our reservation, they were able to seat us right away. Service was quick, attentive and I appreciated that they replaced water glasses rather than refilled them at the table.  We had a selection of Sushi & Sashimi variations (we let the chef decide).  Washed it down with a perfect Pinot and my son chose the various teas (Under age in the USA). Miso was perfect...We than chose additional sashimi to help satisfy our taste for raw fish...Spot On!  Highly recommend this spot on the Southside of Downtown. Dessert included another Pinot (prefer not to mix desserts) Recommend Umai when needing a sushi fix on the south side of downtown before hitting Chinatown.  Cheers!

Umai is in a great location downtown -- close to Columbia college and easily accessible from the Harrison red line stop. My husband and I went here for a Friday night dinner and were surprised by how reasonably priced everything was (and how much food we got!). The atmosphere is fun, kind of trendy, which I would expect from a place that's located so close to a college. The walls are beautifully decorated with colorful murals.

Even though we showed up 30 minutes early for our reservation, they were able to seat us right away. Service was quick and I appreciated that they replaced water glasses rather than refilled them at the table. The only thing that was lacking was the timing our server had. Before we had a chance to look at anything or discuss what we were thinking, she asked if we wanted anything to drink. When we told her that water was fine for now, she took away our drink menu before we could ask to keep it to look it over. We had to ask for it back before ordering our entrees, which created a bit of an awkward situation.

I ordered the asparagus beef rolls, which were delicious. It came with miso soup and a very, very small salad. The miso soup was great and I loved that the salad had a creamy, almost minty kind of dressing. It was very good. The beef rolls themselves were fun. The beef was perfectly cooked and I loved this alternative meat-style sushi roll type thing. It was fun and yummy. With that, I had a pomegranate martini, which was hefty on the alcohol, so it wasn't too sweet and I really enjoyed that.

My husband ordered the toku ramen, which he absolutely loved. It was tons of food and he enjoyed every bite. Everything had lots of flavor and was cooked well. To pair with his meal, he had a plum wine and soda, which was super refreshing and was a nice contrast to his savory meal. I feel like it's a great deal, though, only about $25 per person for an entree and cocktail, which is perfect for a night out -- very easy on the wallet. We're definitely planning to come here again.

This place was so good that we ate here twice during our week in Chicago. (Once to go and once inside.)  Why does Chicago have much better sushi than Seattle?  I've always wondered that because it makes no sense.  Anyway, we did an Asparagus Beef Roll to start and we ordered Ginger Cinnas. (Tempelton rye, Pear nectar, cinnamon, ginger beer...).  For dinner the 2 of us split 3 rolls: Mexicana, White Truffle Tails, and the Umai Crunch.  All were amazing!!  The service is great, food comes out quick, and the atmosphere is fun!

Walked in without a reservation around lunchtime on a Saturday and we were sat down immediately. We were a group of 8 so that was a great plus. The menu was a little too extensive for me, I prefer short menus with quality choices rather than tons of dishes but regardless the food we ordered tasted great and fresh. I had the pork katsu curry and the teriyaki maki, both were pretty tasty. All in all, a good place to go. Pricing is also reasonable.

Umai is hands down the best sushi in the loop. There rice is on point. The selection is unique but also includes classics (California, veggie, spicy tuna). There potstickers are brilliant and they let you chose wether they are pan fried or steamed! Plus you can mix it up chicken & veg. I must say I am not a fan of their udon curry, but not because it isn't made well just because it is too salty. The udon noodles are tender but the sauce/soup is not my style. Still I have yet to find any reason why this wouldn't be my favorite sushi place in the loop.

A little more expensive than Kai a few blocks away for about the same quality food, but a little more space to eat and a bit quicker service.  I went simple with an Unagi Avo Crunchy and a fresh philly roll.  Both were fresh and presented well.  My fianc ordered the chicken teriyaki plate, which came with a starter of miso soup and sides of salad and rice.  There was a good amount of teriyaki sauce which added a nice sweetness to the chicken.  
Will definitely come back to try the udon and ramen!

There's a good variety of food offered here at a fair price point, and the food itself pretty average, nothing amazing or too bad. I've come here a few times, and sushi is usually a safe bet here-- I enjoyed the sloopin', umai crunchi, and molokai, the latter of which was wrapped in thin slices of daikon. The dynamite roll I thought didn't quite work with the spicy crab, and the particular order I had felt like it had been sitting out for a long time since the tempura fried sweet potato was barely warm and had gone a bit soft. The ramen here is also average-- the tonkotsu broth lacked the richness and heartiness that is typical of pork bone based broths. On the plus side, the skewers (especially the pork shoulder) have always been solid the couple times I've ordered them. 

On the dessert side, I really liked the green tea creme brulee, which was a little on the sweet side but had a nice strong flavor of green tea throughout. 

Overall, a decent Japanese place with lots of options at a fair price.

Wide variety of tasty Japanese fare in a beautifully designed and decorated space!

They have options from sushi to ramen to Japanese grill items to dipping noodles! There is something for everyone here.

My table ordered the Beef a Tongue Skewers, Shrimp ShuMai, and the Shrimp Tempura Roll for starters. Then the Miso Ramen, Tonkotsu Ramen, Dipping Ramen, Winter Melon Ramen, and the Sukiyaki for entrees. To finish off this wonderful meal we got the Green Tea Creme Brle and the Black Sesame Ice cream.

The Shrimp Tempura and ShuMai were both very fresh, the Beef Tongue Skewers were tender and came with a great sauce! All of the ramen broths were very delicious and the noodles had a wonderful texture. The Sukiyaki was big enough for two people and was very filling! The Green Tea Creme Brle had such a great green tea flavor and the sesame in the ice cream was incredible!

You know you came to the right place for your Asian food fixation when more than half of the patrons are of Asian heritage.

This place did not disappoint! I had the sushi which was fresh and excellent and my girlfriend had one of their entree dishes that she wouldn't stop raving about.

It's a little on the pricier side for some but well worth the money.

We made reservations an hour in advance on a Saturday evening (~7:30pm) and didn't have much trouble but the place was pretty full with a small wait for those that hadn't called ahead.

If you're in the loop or just south of it and hankering for some Japanese cuisine, definitely give this place a try. You won't regret it!

This place is modern and clean, with good service. With that said, the ramen is just OK and the sushi rolls were just OK (we tried 2 of the ramen bowls and 3 sushi rolls). There's nothing wrong with any of it but there's also nothing great. There are better ramen places and better sushi places.

My friends and I had a hankering for sushi so we stopped in this place since one of my friends been here before. We ordered a couple of rolls to share and it was good. I ordered 10 piece sushi from the sushi bar and my friend ordered the tempura udon. The sushi was really fresh which is always a plus. The prices of this place is not that cheap but you have to expect it since it's not an all you can eat sushi buffet. The restaurant isn't to big and the decor and interior of the place is nice. You can go here after you go shopping at the stores at the Roosevelt icon but it's hard to find parking since but public transportation is really accessible. I would come back and try some other rolls on the menu and their specialties.

Came here the other night when a serious ramen craving kicked in, and overall we were very pleased. Their menu is huuuuuge, plenty of options for anyone's palate! I had the nabeyaki udon, which was pretty good. Lots of fresh veggies, an egg, and shrimp tempura, but the broth wasn't the best I've ever had. My boyfriend ordered the spicy pork ramen and we were both pretty blown away with this dish.  The broth was absolutely delicious, plus the ground pork inside added a great but interesting touch. I will say the additional pork the soup is topped with felt a little lackluster just because we're used to a pork belly round, and this was just a strip of regular pork. 

Looking forward to coming back to try the sukiyaki and sushi rolls!

Our go to neighborhood sushi spot. Consistently good. Our average bill for 2 people with no drinks, is about $85...and that's for to go.  With that said, ordered unagi don and it comes with a miso soup, for $22. But tell me why they can't just fill the soup up. And no, it did not spill on the walk.

A little more expensive than Kai a few blocks away for about the same quality food, but a little more space to eat and a bit quicker service.  I went simple with an Unagi Avo Crunchy and a fresh philly roll.  Both were fresh and presented well.  My fianc ordered the chicken teriyaki plate, which came with a starter of miso soup and sides of salad and rice.  There was a good amount of teriyaki sauce which added a nice sweetness to the chicken.  
Will definitely come back to try the udon and ramen!

There's a good variety of food offered here at a fair price point, and the food itself pretty average, nothing amazing or too bad. I've come here a few times, and sushi is usually a safe bet here-- I enjoyed the sloopin', umai crunchi, and molokai, the latter of which was wrapped in thin slices of daikon. The dynamite roll I thought didn't quite work with the spicy crab, and the particular order I had felt like it had been sitting out for a long time since the tempura fried sweet potato was barely warm and had gone a bit soft. The ramen here is also average-- the tonkotsu broth lacked the richness and heartiness that is typical of pork bone based broths. On the plus side, the skewers (especially the pork shoulder) have always been solid the couple times I've ordered them. 

On the dessert side, I really liked the green tea creme brulee, which was a little on the sweet side but had a nice strong flavor of green tea throughout. 

Overall, a decent Japanese place with lots of options at a fair price.

Wide variety of tasty Japanese fare in a beautifully designed and decorated space!

They have options from sushi to ramen to Japanese grill items to dipping noodles! There is something for everyone here.

My table ordered the Beef a Tongue Skewers, Shrimp ShuMai, and the Shrimp Tempura Roll for starters. Then the Miso Ramen, Tonkotsu Ramen, Dipping Ramen, Winter Melon Ramen, and the Sukiyaki for entrees. To finish off this wonderful meal we got the Green Tea Creme Brle and the Black Sesame Ice cream.

The Shrimp Tempura and ShuMai were both very fresh, the Beef Tongue Skewers were tender and came with a great sauce! All of the ramen broths were very delicious and the noodles had a wonderful texture. The Sukiyaki was big enough for two people and was very filling! The Green Tea Creme Brle had such a great green tea flavor and the sesame in the ice cream was incredible!

You know you came to the right place for your Asian food fixation when more than half of the patrons are of Asian heritage.

This place did not disappoint! I had the sushi which was fresh and excellent and my girlfriend had one of their entree dishes that she wouldn't stop raving about.

It's a little on the pricier side for some but well worth the money.

We made reservations an hour in advance on a Saturday evening (~7:30pm) and didn't have much trouble but the place was pretty full with a small wait for those that hadn't called ahead.

If you're in the loop or just south of it and hankering for some Japanese cuisine, definitely give this place a try. You won't regret it!

This place is modern and clean, with good service. With that said, the ramen is just OK and the sushi rolls were just OK (we tried 2 of the ramen bowls and 3 sushi rolls). There's nothing wrong with any of it but there's also nothing great. There are better ramen places and better sushi places.

Ordered on NYE despite not wanting to, because I hate making people work when I don't want to. But I was very impressed. They still delivered through Grubhub and the meal as very great!

From New York to LA, I finally found a sushi restaurant I liked. My five-star breakdown:

Service - Outstanding! Waiter was super sweet, and made sure my tea cup never fell past the 3/4 mark.

Hot Green Tea - Refreshing, and perfect way to kick off your dinner.

Miso Soup - I didn't have to reach for my water glass at all during dinner. One of the best miso soups I've ever had.

Umai Salad - Greens were amazingly crunchy, carrots were perfectly blanched, and sweet potatoes were cutely cut into flowers. Roasted sesame dressing really amped up the salad.

Wasabi Shumai - I love wasabi so I wish the wasabi flavor was stronger. 

Sukiyaki - I'm drooling just thinking about it. The thinly sliced beefed loins paired well with the grilled onions and shirataki noodles, which all rested in a savory sukiyaki sauce.

Omai Grand - Every piece tasted fresh out of the water. My favorite was the smoked salmon sashimi. 

This place is definitely worth the monthly plane ride from NYC to Chicago.

Ahhhhh love Umai!!! It's a cute restaurant, with great service and delicious food in Printer's Row, which is in a fantastic part of the city. I had the tonkatsu ramen and the katsu curry! Omg the curry is AMAZING - it's just $12 and is hugeeeeeeee. So delicious too! It's a bed of rice with a giant, perfectly breaded piece of chicken and drenched generously with curry. The only downside is that there's minimal vegetables (but just have a salad later or something). The katsu curry lasted me for two meals (although understandably, reheated it isn't as great). So yummy and will definitely be back again :)

Really fresh fish and great selection. Rice was delicious.

First visit we dined in. I had the nama sake don (delicious) and husband had the tempura dinner.

Second visit was delivery. Husband had katsudon (he raved about the taste), which was HUGE. I had the moriawase sashimi with a spicy tuna roll. So good!

Because I go here all the time since it's close to where my boyfriend lives, I had to write this and give this place a shoutout! 
Not only is it convenient and that I am a sushi fanatic, but they do a really good job of getting your food in time and correct. We have eaten here a few times but usually get take-out, and eat at home... and every time, no issue, no reason to call back and say they forgot something.
They are all super nice as well! 

And as for the food.... YUM! I love the salmon shoyaki and I always get either pork gyoza or shrimp shumai. Then to top it off, at least 2 rolls of sushi. (Avocado, cucumber, or California) Spicy tuna if I'm feeling crazy. That's usually our order. But if we are hungover, the ramen is our go-to. Best hangover cure- hands down! Food is always good, never fails to make my stomach happy & recently got the mochi, which was good too, but sadly they  were out of strawberry and mango which are my favorites, but the green tea and red bean weren't too bad. 

Anyways, if you're in the south loop area and looking for a spot to have some sushi, UMAI forsure! Must try it out.

This is my go to sushi place in the South Loop. Service is very friendly. Make sure to call ahead to get a table during busier hours (weekend nights), otherwise fairly easy to snag a table. My go to specialty rolls are Mexicana and Chicago, both are salmon and tuna combo rolls. Mexicana adds a nice fusion kick to the standard spicy roll and is visually pleasing, especially if you're a connosieur of aesthetics. Chicago is a unique blend of flavors, most notably cucumber and honey miso, reflecting the diversity of its namesake. In addition, Umai has a classy yet cozy ambiance, ideal for a date night or catching up with friends.

I came here with a friend on a Friday night at around 8 and it was so busy! Being out of towners, we put our names down regardless to get seated. The estimate for a 2 person table was an hour wait. We sat in the waiting area chatting away and noticed that there were several empty tables in the restaurant. It wasn't until another party mentioned something to the hostess when we promptly got seated. So, minus 1 star for them there. 

The food, however, gets a 5 stars. We ordered a crunchy eel avocado roll, scallops sashimi, and two bowls of the nabeyaki udon. The eel avocado with the crunch was the perfect balance. The scallops were very fresh. (if you've never had scallops sashimi, do yourself a favor and order it!!) The udon was perfect for a nice fall night in Chicago. Though, I wish I had taken out my shrimp tempura from the broth before it got soggy.

We chatted with a bunch of other customers that were dining and it seems like Umai is their top pick for sushi in the area!

I've been here twice and both times had a good experience. It's a great restaurant to go to if you're watching a movie at Showplace Icon and looking for a place to eat since there aren't many food options near the theater. 

The first time I went there, I ordered the Katsu Kare. The portion was huge; I could only finish half of it. Hardly any of the Japanese restaurants I've been to serve Katsu Kare so I was pleasantly surprised to see it on the menu. I thought the curry had good flavor. It's definitely a comfort dish.

Most recently, I ordered the Spicy Roasted Garlic Pork Ramen - spicy miso ground pork, wakame seaweed, fish cake, half boiled egg, Japanese leeks, braised pork belly and garlic chips. The broth had great flavor and the pork was cooked perfectly. I highly recommend it for people that love ramen. 

Overall, Umai has great food. It's a good option if you're in the area and craving Japanese food.

Tonkotsu Ramen must be difficult to master and a whole lot to live up to since it's a classic Japanese entree. The soup base is lacking flavor despite having upgraded to black garlic oil. 

From the luncheon special menu, the salmon entree came with side salad and miso soup. The salmon was dressed in a sweet sauce and cooked to a firm texture.

The most anticipated of all: green tea crm brle. To which was also a sliding disappointment.

After a long, fun day of exploring Chicago, we wanted something comforting and good for dinner, which to us equates soup! So we ventured out to Umai for ramen. Saturday night, 8 PM, no reservations, party of 7, you guessed it, 1-1.5 hours wait. They got us in at 45 mins. We ordered shrimp shumai, sushi, hangar steak, and tongue for appetizers. The hangar steak(very tender)and Chicago roll were my favorites. I had the spicy garlic pork Ramen, my husband had the winter Ramen, and my son had salmon teriyaki. All were good. Mine in particular, flavorful, but not over salty broth, generous amount of meat, noodles had the perfect bite. All of the food came out pretty fast and at the right time. Tried the green tea creams brle and it was just ok, the brle wasn't set enough. Overall a pretty good experience and will definitely go back when we're in Chicago again!

This is my first yelp review I have ever written. The reason is that I just left this place a min ago. The server who serve us wasn't good but we still manage to pay 10% tips and when she came she demand us that we must pay 15% tips. This place is really a scam. I think we should pay according to the service not what they expect from me.

Solid sushi spot in South Loop!

Been here 3 times and no complaints as the sushi is pretty good and service has been stellar.
I've had the following and they are all good!

Spicy Tuna
Naked Maki
Caterpillar Roll
Spicy Shrimp Tempura
Seaweed Salad
Spicy Hamachi
Escolar (sashimi)
Unagi (sashimi)
Spicy Roasted Garlic Pork Ramen
Ton Kotsu Ramen (Chef Recommended) 


They get pretty packed around noon and later in the evenings so to be on the safe side you may want to reserve. If you live in the building, they will deliver to you.

I never had beef tongue before. I was afraid to try it, but it didn't look as bad as I thought it would be. It takes even better than it looks!! So yummy.  Highly recommend beef tongue for your appetizer!

As a guest from Portland, OR where folks take their fresh sushi rather seriously this place was a hit. 4.5 stars for sure! Miso soup was excellent with large chunks of tofu, soft shell crab roll was phenomenal worth just the right crunch on the crab. The basic spicy tuna roll was great, the fresh tuna took spotlight and spoke for itself, fresh and spicy to the tastebuds! Finally, the gold star goes to the Mexican roll with cilantro, avocado, tuna and salmon, altho fb it sounds strange, just get it you won't be disappointed. We sat at the Sushi bar and the chef takes great pride in his work and the entire staff has fun but take their craft very seriously!

This place was fantastic and had it all. It's a hip and trendy restaurant that is great for date night because you can dress down or up and fit in. 

The service is wonderful as well. They have a gray cocktail selection. I had the lychee martinis and it was delightful. Not too sweet and it brings actual lychee to be able to eat!

The beef hangar appetizer was my favorite!!! It was so tender and it had a great sweet sauce on it. 

The sashimi was very fresh. I tried the tuna and salmon. 

My friend and I shared several rolls and sadly I can't remember the names but they were all so good!! 

My friend had their creams brle. The initial
Bite was different, interesting. But as she continued to eat she really grew to appreciate the dessert and love it. 

The only dish that didn't taste like all the flavors went together was their salmon carpaccio.

The white rice was great. I know it's white rice...but it was a nice surprise that it was a tad sweet. It complimented the fish very well. 

The fish was quality and very fresh. We had a variety of fish and every bite was better than the first. 

Miso soup...very flavorful. The waiter knew we were splitting all of the dishes so he made sure we each had some soup. Which was just enough for how many rolls we ordered. 

We ordered a ramen soup bowl...not sure what the name was but it was VERY good. Just enough noodles. Just enough spice. And just enough meat (a pork slice and maybe a spicy ground sausage). 

The only negative was we ordered a special roll, I believe it was the Cajun roll...not my favorite. I only had one piece....it was like a regular dry roll with extra red and green peppers with Cajun spices sprinkled on top. I was expecting something else...maybe something with a spicy sauce.
I didn't let that one roll ruin everything that was fantastic.

My fault for not looking at the menu and getting the names of the dishes....next time

The food is good but not impressive. There aren't many choices on weekends in downtown and Umai is the best option for me. Sometimes they forgot to put soy sauce or chopsticks in pickup orders but not really a big deal.

The food was amazing. The ambiance, art and music gives you a comfortable lounge feel. Minus $2 for a canned soda and added gratuity to your bill, the prices were decent. The service- more so the server- was not. We, a group of 5, came in around 9pm. All of us are tourists and were just looking for a place to chill for a bit and found Umai via Yelp. After our waitress came, we ordered multiple rolls- nothing outlandish and were weren't loud or behaving gaudily. The waitress was rude and upset because two of us asked her for a breakdown of a few rolls. She was reluctant to help us and was visibly frustrated. We stayed until closing but weren't the last to leave. She was upset by this as well. Maybe come during the day.

This is my first yelp review I have ever written. The reason is that I just left this place a min ago. The server who serve us wasn't good but we still manage to pay 10% tips and when she came she demand us that we must pay 15% tips. This place is really a scam. I think we should pay according to the service not what they expect from me.

Solid sushi spot in South Loop!

Been here 3 times and no complaints as the sushi is pretty good and service has been stellar.
I've had the following and they are all good!

Spicy Tuna
Naked Maki
Caterpillar Roll
Spicy Shrimp Tempura
Seaweed Salad
Spicy Hamachi
Escolar (sashimi)
Unagi (sashimi)
Spicy Roasted Garlic Pork Ramen
Ton Kotsu Ramen (Chef Recommended) 


They get pretty packed around noon and later in the evenings so to be on the safe side you may want to reserve. If you live in the building, they will deliver to you.

This place is only okay. I can see why it would be popular because it feels really trendy but the food is just okay and it's a bit expensive.

Ginger cinca cocktail: was ridiculously sweet. Couldn't taste the ginger beer at all. Not strong either.
Spicy roasted garlic pork ramen: okay until I ate some raw ginger. Also wasn't spicy at all
Mexicana roll: meh. No flavors stood out. Wouldn't order again 

On the upside, the service was really great. Props to the waitresses for being on top of everything and bartending at the same time.

Umai is my "now, where was that place" place. 

I've been here enough times that it really shouldn't be in my restaurant blind spot but I think that after last night, I've finally got it locked on my mental map - (Blue line LaSalle, walk to Polk) - though the exterior looks totally different without the summertime patio. (Quite possibly the noisiest, horn-honkiest intersection on which a patio sits, by the way.)

Ramen!! It's delicious. I've tried several and so far, "winter ramen" tops my list ($14.00) It's "medium" spice but they can dial it upon request.  The broth is well-layered and the beef, so tender. Sushi I've had here has always been fresh and service has been easily five stars. (I've had same server three times over five months, inside/outside! and he is always smiling.)

I find the prices slightly steep for the location though and also, there's no happy hour. I think it's ok to mention that a fun neighborhood bar "First Draft" opened not too long ago across Clark and "Sociale" just went in across Polk, so this area is definitely growing. When you want ramen though, you want ramen! I'm definitely locked on Umai.

We were craving some ramen and sushi and found this gem on Yelp. The food was definitely delicious, and fish portions were great- nice and thick. Service was not the best though. Our waitress took a while getting our orders, and this was when the restaurant was pretty empty also. Nonetheless, we were very satisfied with our food:

Chicago roll: a crowd favorite! We had about 3 orders of this roll- delicious with good portions of fresh tasting fish with nice additional flavors in the sauce.
Mexicana roll: this was also good, I'm just not a big fan of jalapeo in my sushi. But it was a nice refreshing roll otherwise.

Overall, food was excellent and the restaurant atmosphere was great, with good smells of ramen and sushi. Besides the slow service, we had a great experience!

Very good sushi spot downtown. Customer service was very patient - my card wasn't working and they must have tried it 6 or 7 times. 

Highly recommend the spicy garlic ramen - the broth was super savory with tiny bits of meat infused in it and the noodles were nice and chewy. 

The golden roe sushi was excellent, didn't have a strong fishy taste and came with a little shredded radish on the side - highly recommend. The eel and avocado roll was solid but nothing to write home about. All were a decent value at ~7 for a small roll or $14 for ramen. 

Would definitely come back here next time I'm in the mood for a Japanese bite.

There are so many options here to choose from! From katsu to ramen to sushi to BBQ, you get your pick depending on you're in the mood for! I got the Mexicana signature maki which was pretty good. The regular maki roll was solid too. Their portions are decent. Busy on a weeknight, so service can be a bit harried but overall somewhere very convenient for a Japanese meal in that area.

Compared to sushi places in SF, Umai was average but good enough to satisfy your sushi craving. Our hotel was on S Michigan Ave, right across the street from Grant Park, so Umai was within a nice walking distance. We walked in on a Thursday night and didn't have to wait to get a seat.

I ordered the 10 pc omakase, and the boyfriend ordered a couple rolls. I think he had the White Tuna Jalapeno roll, Chicago roll and a hamachi roll. The fish was fresh and well-presented, but overall nothing super special.

The decor was super nice. Umai is definitely trying to pull off a modern, upscale-ish, hipster-y atmosphere.

If you're looking for some sushi while you're in the South Loop area, I would give this a try.

Umai is a nice sushi bar in South Loop. It has been packed the last few times I came by (early evening) and we waited about 20 mins to be seated. Food is reasonably priced and delicious. I have tried different sushi rolls and entrees and generally liked them all. I am not the biggest fan of the drinks - they might not be my thing. Tried lychee martini twice ( I thought the second time around would be better), but they are just too sweet for me.

This is by far the worst possible place to have Japanese food in Chicago. I live in Chicago for 11 years now and every week I look for new restaurants and this was by far the worst experience. Out of the 7 different dishes we ordered, 1 was "ok" and all other 6 were disgusting. The fried chicken had more oil than an actual oil bottle. The fried oyster same thing. We ordered a special spicy maki and instead of making the elements of the maki spicy, they pretty much rolled all ingredients together and added and exorbitant amount os seasoning (spicy cajun seasoning) on top of the role. I took a close pic for reference. If I could I would rate this place 0 stars!!!!

I went to have dinner on Sunday and to my surprise it was full, even though it was the coldest night of December. It is a good idea to make reservations as the place seemed to be full. I called at around 6 pm to make reservation for 8 pm of the same day. We were pretty lucky.

For appetizer, we had chicken lollipops and sushi appetizer and for dinner had Nabeyaki Udon and Katze Kare. I could not even express how much happy I was after finding a real Kare in Chicago. There is no other place that serves such amazing Kare and other Japanese food. The service is impeccable. The staff are so friendly and caring.

I cant wait to be back again for Katze Kare and other delicacies. I do not eat seafood which constituents most of the food in the menu, however there are lot of chicken/pork based food.

I'm more than a bit obsessed with ramen and I have to say that I was pretty disappointed by Umai. The service and atmosphere was great, and it was perfect for one person dining alone. I never felt rushed or sidelined.

Unfortunately, my dish of spicy garlic ramen tasted suspiciously like Shin Ramyun Black ($1/bag) ramen with a few bits of meat and garlic put in. It wasn't terrible but it certainly wasn't worth the $13+ price tag.

While I much appreciate that they have a brown/purple rice option (not all places do), my order came to over $30 and there were only 6 small pieces of each sushi roll and 4 small pieces of the shumai. The yellowtail was inedible, the salmon/avocado was good, and the shrimp shumai was good, but seriously 4 pieces? The price is not commensurate with the amount and quality in my opinion.

Have tried many Japanese restaurants and Umai is consistently 5 stars for me and my family: tops in food variety, specials, comfy food staples like ramen & bowl dishes, superb friendly & professional service from greeters to servers. Upscale yet communal dining area. Cozy outdoor cafe too!

Quaint place! We were very happy with our meals and our service. We especially enjoyed our server. She genuinely seemed like a happy person who enjoys her job. That is always a huge bonus!

Our sushi, rolls, and soup were all good. Overall experience I would say: 3.5 Stars.

Service, alone, 4 to 4.5 stars. Again, everybody was great! Food, for sushi/rolls/tempura, was about average of what we've had. Ambiance was alright, not bad.

I think my main reduction in the food score was that the menu seemed too all over the place. It's pretty huge. So, it didn't feel like they had a focus or true specialty items. Our server, however, did make recommendations and let us know of the most 'popular' dishes. I guess nothing we tried really grabbed me as amazing, that's all, but it was good.

That said though, we will definitely be back. It's a great neighborhood spot. I'd like to try more of their plates, and I recommend Umai!

The good: decent layout of the restaurant plus they had a  small outdoor seating which was nice. The staff was friendly and responsive. The place was clean. The menu was large which I liked 
The food "in my opinion" was average. I'll go back of I'm in the area but wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to eat there because Chicago has so many great places to eat. 
I had the super white tuna as an appetizer and the winter ramen as the meal. Both not bad but not mind blowing either.

My daughters wanted California rolls and noodles. I was happy to find that this place has ramen! Not much good ramen found in the city these days. Although the Ribeye Ramen is not the best, it'll do after a long day. The cool thing is that this place allows you to add more ramen, eggs, chashu and other goodies to your ramen for a price. The nigiri also came out as fresh and plump. Oh! And the lollipop chicken appetizer in a cream sauce is also very good. It's only 5 pieces, but it's a good starter.

Good food, reasonable prices, lots of asian customers (indicating quality and authenticity), and low-key electronic music remixes as background noise.  The best dish was the Beef Hanger Tender, from the BBQ section, well marinated, one of the most flavorful pieces of beef I've ever had.  I could eat 6 of them and be satisfied.  We also tried both the Ton Katsu ramen and the Spicy Roasted Garlic Pork Ramen, which were both from the same creamy broth.  Generous, generous portion of noodles and slices of Chashu, very filling.  Spicy roasted garlic pork has ground pork and spicy oil on top, not too spicy, overall very similar to the ton katsu.  Finished with Green Tea Creme Brulee.  Not too sweet (just the caramelized topping), creamy custard, sliced grape on top felt out of place (flavor didn't match to me).

I'm visitor to Chicago... My hotel suggested this place. I ordered a simple soup and they were very accommodating because I wanted it customized. I thought it was OK. The reason I gave it four stars is because I saw other peoples plates and it looked delicious I just happen to be in the mood for soup but Sushi looked really fresh but again I didn't have that, I just had a soup. And again the very accommodating here so that's why I gave it four stars.

Ate here with a friend, as I recently moved in down the street.  The food isn't bad (as stated by others, a bit steep for the neighborhood though) and they have great service.  Everything that we both ordered was good, fresh, and the Ramen was good also. 

Also has a fun atmosphere.

Slow service. Waiters were not attentive. My water glass was empty for over 30 min and literally two tables to my right got water and the table to my left got water. I got nothing. I tried to get a waiter's attention but no one came. The ramen is a bit salty. Try to eat it when it's hot as it gets saltier as it cools down. I got the ton kotsu ramen and my friend got the spicy roasted garlic pork (not spicy). It's okay but I have a different favorite place for ramen.

I have not tried that many ramen places in the city but i truly enjoyed this one. On a Friday night for dinner for 2, we waited about 35 minutes. The host quoted us the time and said we had to be in person in the restaurant when our table was ready (they don't take phone numbers) so we got a drink down the road. 

Our server went out of his way to explain the menu to us and make suggestions for both food and cocktails. He was very attentive despite the venue being packed. 

My dinner mate and I discussed which we like better- broth or noodles and I have to say BOTH. I CLEANED UP this ramen let me tell you. We both ordered the spicy roasted garlic ramen and it was delish. The broth is so flavorful and healing. The noodles are perfectly cooked- al dente at first but soften as you stir them in the broth. 

Delicious all around and I'll be back to try other flavors.

My husband and I have been to Strings for some ramen, and we both agreed that they're pretty comparable. The service was very nice. They need some curtains for their windows though. During our warmer-than-usual 50 degree November visit, we sat right next to the windows, which got to be a bit hot. I felt like an ant under a microscope!! I can't imagine what it'd be like during the summer.

We started off with some of the pork belly buns. They were yummy, but the meat was a little thick. Made it a bit hard to bite into. Probably not the best appetizer for your first date night.

My husband had an original tonkotsu, which was pretty standard for Japanese ramen.

I had the Spicy roasted garlic miso, which was also good. I almost thought that I would be melting eating that and being under the microscope, but I fared alright. The garlic flavor didn't seem to be there though. It wasn't as spicy as I thought either. If you can't take much spice, I don't recommend it.

Overall thoughts: Pretty tasty, standard prices (for Japanese ramen). In need of some design reconsideration.

Spoiled to be in a city with so many great ramen spots. Wasabi builds on Chicago's slate of tasty Japanese soup shops. Their broth is not too oily and they use noodles that hold up well. 

Don't sleep on their non-soup dishes. I suggest trying their tuna poke bowls.

We've been to the old Wasabi multiple times but this is our second time coming to the new one... and definitely they've sacrificed quality of service for a "better" building.

I put better in quotes because during the day, the lack of shades make you feel like you are roasting... I would hope a place with such open windows would also have shades. Not so pleasant to eat hot ramen while also hot indoors.

The food took 40 minutes to get to us. We are a table of 5 and three other groups got their food before us and left despite coming after us. We had to ask for water and they gave it to us after a while. We only got the standard ramen too, so it wasn't anything special.

The ramen is okay, so that's the only saving grace. Forced tip for 5 or more (usually is 6) so just fyi, it's 20%.

When it's 40 degrees out nothing is better than a solid bowl of ramen. However, be sure not to come hangry like we did because there will most likely be a wait on the weekends. Even if you arrive 30 minutes after they open.

It was about a 45 minute wait for the two of us and we were seated at the bar. We started off with two appetizers, the sashimi carpaccio and takoyaki. Both were delicious! But we really came for the ramen. Both of us got the spicy roasted garlic miso and it hit the spot. The noodles were a good texture and the broth was flavorful but didn't find it to be at all spicy. Wasabi is definitely one of the better ramen joints out there. But I'm not surprised since it's sister restaurant is ramen takeya, which is also one of my favorite spots.

Another note, I guess they don't combine their ramen and sushi anymore. Instead they have two store fronts now but they're right next to each other.

Wasabi is my absolute favorite ramen spot that I've tried so far. I wish I could eat there every day! The spicy garlic miso ramen is absolutely addicting. It has the perfect amount of spice that you could just keep eating more and more of it. The portion was decent enough for two of us to split (with a few small plates) but next time I would ask for more noodles if I was going to share. My husband kept stealing all the noodles. On my first visit, we tried the pork belly buns and got a few orders of them. The second visit I discovered the pork belly & kimchee spring rolls and I think those are even better. I honestly could have just ate two plates of those and died happy.

The place is pretty small, but even still, our wait was only 5 minutes or so. There's also a bar with open seating that had plenty of room during our visit on a Sunday night.

I have been searching for a Ramen place in Chicago that had GOOD RAMEN. From broth to noddle to a little spice and finally I found it.

First thing first, if you come here please expect to wait. We were there when they opened at 5 pm on a Saturday and before you could SnapChat the sign the place was packed! It is about an hour wait, but we made our way in faster somehow!

The menu is packed full of goodness. One thing I wasn't a fan of is the menu noted "Sliders" but you only get a slider, just a bit misleading. Out table had drinks, from the Old Fashioned to the Shiso Perfect. Both good drinks, the shisho perfect had flavors of a mojito but still interesting.

For an appetizer, we picked the Pork belly Kimchee Spring Roll with the micro greens and house tartar sauce. It was perfect. The tartar sauce didn't overpower the natural flavors and allowed the pork belly and kimchee to shine through.

On to the RAMEN!

I ordered the Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso with the added Park Belly Char Siu (it is pork belly marinated in like a sweet and sour sauce).  It was perfect. The broth had great flavors in it, delectable taste and a perfect balance of vegetables, noodles, and broth. The pork was so tender you wanted to eat more. The one criticism is that the pork had too much fat on it. You could literally be chewing a big piece of fat, not good.

Also ordered at our table was the Original Tonkotsu and the Tokyo Classic Shoyu. The Original and Spicy Roasted Garlic both have this bit of a creamy broth while the Tokyo Classic was more of a lighter base, however all GREAT options

My initial reaction to Wasabi was worrisome because we were the only Asians in an Asian restaurant; none of the workers nor customers at the time were Asian which usually isn't a good sign haha!  Alas, I trusted my fellow Yelpers' positive reviews and they did not leave me astray!  Wasabi blew us away, they really know how to make a fantastic bowl of ramen!

My teenagers are ramen fanatics and they are pretty critical about their ramen. They LOVED their bowls of the Original Tonkotsu ($13).  It included delicious Berkshire pork belly, soft boiled egg, black mushrooms and scallions.  The broth was awesome; it was creamy & rich and the noodles were firm and chewy. Now in comparison to the other ramen houses, my teenagers think Hokkaido Ramen Santouka's (Mitsuwa) tonkotsu broth still rules and the noodles at Strings Ramen are the best.  However, Wasabi is definitely tops on their ramen house list now!

I got the Hakata Classic ramen ($13) which had similar toppings of the Original Tonkotsu but it had pickled ginger which gave it a nice flavor!  I also added the Spice Umami flavor booster for an additional $2; my bowl of ramen was so good!    

My 10 yr old got the "Chicken Nuggets" which she loved.  The takoyaki appetizer was delicious and seaweed salad was yummy!

We arrived at Wasabi when they first opened on a Saturday night, so there wasn't a wait. The decor is cute and clean.  The servers were very attentive and friendly.  Wasabi is a definite must if you are in the Logan Square area!

Visited last night for dinner and we were pleasantly surprised.  The interior is modern with low lights very contemporary.  While we didn't enjoy our 45min wait, we got cozy at the bar over several rounds of cocktails (Shisho Perfect and Wisper of the heart) that bartender put a lot of effort into making. 

Seating against the window gets a bit cold due to draft, I recommend getting one of the interior tables.  Our server was a bit slow but once you catch her attention she was friendly.  

We ordered crispy brussel sprouts, chicken buns, vegan tan tan men, and wagyu beef bowl. All of the dishes we delicious and arranged to perfection.  I think I have found my new favorite restaurant in Logan Square.  This area has been on my radar for a while now, I'll be back to try their new Sushi restaurant next door.  

FYI- most online review suggests wasabi is BYOB, it's a full bar restaurant so not a BYOB.  Although their next door sushi establishment is new and still a BYOB.

Went in around 7:45 PM. The hostess was super nice and told us it would be about an hour and that we could go somewhere and come back in 45 minutes.

We went to Table, Stick and Donkey for a drink (highly recommend!), and were seated about 10 mins after we came back. Atmosphere was nice and our server was helpful as well. The Yakotori was just like the ones i had in Japan. I got a ramen with chicken broth and my boyfriend got ramen with pork broth. I liked my ramen, but I've had better noodles. Also, the additions (pork, egg, veggies) were kind of lacking. 

Despite all of this, I would have given the restaurant 4 stars, because the food, service and decor was great. However, my boyfriend ended up getting food poisoning right after and was sick for a day and a half. My ramen with the chicken broth didn't leave me sick. Definitely a bummer, because it sounds like we won't be going out for ramen any time soon!

Best Ramen EVER!

The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because it's in Chicago and not Tennessee (where I reside).

A table for 6 on a Sunday afternoon with no wait. Beware - all parties must be in attendance before they can seat you. 

The menu was absolutely mouthwatering. Everything from appetizers to entrees, were described perfectly and encouraged my curiosity. We ordered several appetizers to share and had of course ramen. The flavors did not disappoint. The items were delayed coming out but because everything is made as you order. And totally worth the wait. 

If you're ever in Chicago, I highly recommend this place!!! You will not be disappointed.**FYI its on the outskirts of downtown Chicago, so catch an Uber/Lyft. 

Items ordered:
Fried Chicken Nuggets - juicy, fresh, tender inside, and perfectly crisp outside. P.S the sauce is yummy!
Pork Belly Buns 
Pork Belly and Kimchee spring roll - large portion, AMAZING sauce!
Crispy Brussels Sprouts - generous portion and yummy.
Original Tonkotsu 
Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso - SUPERB! I loved EVERYTHING about this dish. It is an ABSOLUTE MUST!

This is, by far, my FAVORITE place to eat traditional Japanese ramen in the city... maybe even on this side of the U.S. (I hear Cali has some good spots)

I've had a couple of bites from their other dishes as well, and they've been tasty as well, but I go out of my way to get here when I need my ramen fix . Be careful: you may never want ramen from anywhere else, and ESPECIALLY not the kind you get in packages at the grocery store.

Want to know how serious this place is? 

Check it:

I ALWAYS bring the people I care about most here if they've never been, family and friends alike.

I once met a Japanese guy, born & raised in Japan,  studying English here & we became good friends (I used to study Japanese). I took him to this spot, and as soon as we walked in he said it smelled like home, and (later) that one of the chefs cooking behind the counter looked like his grandpa.

Fast forward to us getting our food:

 I don't remember what all we got (we got ramen and a few other dishes), but we both barely spoke a word as we were devouring our dishes. 

I usually either get the Tonkotsu ramen, or my personal favorite, the Spicy Garlic ramen. Be careful- the latter can get pretty spicy, so they can tone it down if you prefer.

They've expanded the restaurant as well~ I believe so one side could be dedicated to the ramen (I could be wrong). The service is usually phenomenal as well.

We were going to go to Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya for some ramen but they weren't open. After stopping by a few places closer to Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya and finding they were also not open. We ended up with Wasabi. We got there a few minutes before they opened. Waited a few minutes and was seated. The staff was friendly and attentive. I ordered the Tokyo Shoyu and my lunch companion ordered the original tonkatsu. Both broths were saltier than I would prefer but I think that's normal for ramen. Both of the dishes had a healthy portion of pork and half of an egg. Each of our bowls was about $14. 

I don't think there was a parking lot... so we parked on the street and paid the meter. We were in an out in about 45 mins.

I enjoyed my experience and would come back to try one of the other dishes.

Love, love, love this place!  I can genuinely say they have the best Ramen in the city.  Usually a long wait but so worth it.

If you come after 7:00 p.m on any night (especially one with cold weather) you will likely have to wait.  Easy street parking on Milwaukee Ave.

My favorite items on the menu are the Brussel sprouts small plate.  Perfectly pout inducing (not sure if it's lemon or vinegar, but it's delicious!).  I love the spicy, garlic ramen.  The broth is so good and its clear that the chefs/cooks use high-quality food items to get the real deal taste.

On my third attempt to come here, I was severely turned off by the superiority complex of this spot.

We pulled up to ask the wait time on a Friday night, predicting something decent given it was the weekend, weather and overall vibe we could see from outside.

"One hour, forty five minutes. We will call your name."

Call my name ... out loud? Are you kidding me? You have the smallest, narrowest bar, NO waiting space near the hostess stand and expect us to stand around for the majority of a Michael Bay flick to hear our name being yelled out like it's the '90s?

Your ramen's good, but this setup is terrible. If you're going for a hipster trendy vibe, use technology like your target audience. The No Wait app is used by Au Cheval (best burger in America) and High Five (better ramen than yours) both use it, and are still incredibly successful.

I loved the ramen until I experienced this. What a turn off. We went elsewhere and spent about twice as much as we would've here but it was worth it.

This place is my girlfriend's favorite ramen place so we decided to come here last week. I have actually never had gourmet ramen before  as I have just had the instant ramen like back in college. 

We ordered Edamame and Pork Dumplings to start. The Edamame is just Edamame so obviously nothing special. The pork dumplings were weird as they were cut up into separate pieces; however, they were pretty good. I ordered the Spicy Roasted Garlic Miss and it was delicious! I love spicy food and will admit it had quite a punch of heat. My girlfriend ordered the Original Tonkotsu, which she has had before. 

Apparently, Wasabi just renovated their place separating their Sushi and Ramen restaurants. Wasabi Ramen was a sleek restaurant with a large communal table, separate tables, and bar. It was nice and everything, but I couldn't stand the house music in the background as I don't feel that it is fitting for a Japanese restaurant. It appears that the sushi restaurant is more traditional and Oriental. With that being said, I thought the ramen was delicious and I will definitely have to try it again!

Came by here for lunch on a weekday and it was pretty busy. There was plenty of street parking available. The restaurant is small and modern but welcoming. We were seated promptly but then there was the mystery of whether we had a server. He finally presented himself after about a 10 minute wait. We started with the gyoza which they say they make in house. It was very delicious. The dipping sauce was more vinegar than usual and made it stand out. I tried the tonkatsu ramen. The broth was super rich and savory. Overall it was a very good ramen but not the best I have had. I actually thought it was a little bit bland, so may consider adding the flavor booster option next time. The pork belly was some of the best I have ever had. Also the bamboo was very well prepared. Noodles were perfectly cooked. My husband had the hakata ramen. It was quite delicious. It was pretty spicy but not "face melting" as threatened by the menu. The biggest problems were with the service. I wasn't checked in on by the server until almost done with my meal. We also ordered hot tea which was a bit insulting- $3 for a tea bag in warm (not hot) water, and then had a hard time getting anyone to pour new water. 

Overall I would say the food is definitely worth coming for, but the service was really disappointing.

Wasabi offers one of the best broth in town. Yes, they've split the restaurant into two (their sister restaurant is Wasabi Sushi and Robota next door), and yes.. we may have awkwardly brought in our own wine and beer by accident (didn't get the memo about BYOB being cancelled) .. but overall, the decision to do so has cut down on waiting times (remember the old days with 1+ hour waits for two?) and was likely the smarter business choice, so that they may charge for alcohol.

We had the Spicy Tokyo Wings and Pork Belly Buns. Spicy Tokyo Wings definitely have a kick. They were well cooked, and the flavor had a darker flavor that reminded me a little of gochujang (Korean red chili paste). The pork belly in the Pork Belly Buns was cooked well. The buns were a fusion twist of the traditional gua bao (Taiwanese pork belly buns), and had the usual cilantro and pickled flavors replaced with blander flavors like lettuce and mayo. The garnish could have been better distributed with the meat, to help add more variety and flavors with each bite. Both sides were prepared well, but left something to be desired. If I were to order again, I would skip the Spicy Tokyo Wings.

My ramen, the Original Tonkotsu, was delicious. I am always a fan of their noodles, which have just the right level of chew and texture. The broth is the best in city so far for me- it is flavorful with pork and roasty, with a creamy finish (though, not as creamy as other locations). I had a sip of the Tokyo Classic Shoyu broth which was surprisingly light and packed with flavor, a great alternative for those looking for a less oily and heavy dish.

There are some things I do miss about the previous location. It's nice that we are no longer elbow to elbow and talking loudly over the room, and it has a brighter, more modern atmosphere compared to the previous feel of the restaurant, which felt more hole in the wall and grudgy with its dimmed lighting. The one thing I miss though is seeing the old Asian man stirring the gigantic pot of broth. That was a sight, and for some reason, made me feel like the broth you were getting was really legit.

We had an automatic 20% gratuity added for our party of five. Our waitress was attentive and thorough with going through the menu. For some odd reason, there was always a long line for the bathroom.

Overall, I love returning to Wasabi and its wonderful ramen. The BYOB and elements of the past atmosphere are missed.

Ramen Wasabi is quite yummy...I must admit. I like ramen and have gone to a couple of places around the city such as Furious Spoon and Ramen San, and I must say Wasabi is my fave. 

A few friends and I decided to go here before a show and it was a great decision. We got there right when they opened and people quickly filled in. So get here right when they open or you'll wait an hour for a table. 

Wasabi is a lively little space. Great music, nice decor, and jamming! I like how they keep the sushi restaurant separate but I don't think it would hurt if they knocked down the wall between the 2 to create more space. 

Our waitress was great. It took her a while to come, we figured they forgot about us since we were in the back of the restaurant, but she care eventually. She was very helpful with menu suggestions and explaining the tastes you would have with the ramen we were deciding between. 

Now on to the good stuff...THE FOOD! It was delicious. All four of us loved what we ordered. We started with the edamame and pork belly and kimchee spring roll. We were going to get the slider, but our waitress advised not too. She said it's only 1 slider per order so it wouldn't have been worth it for the 4 of us to order. So we passed on that and went for the spring rolls, which she said were good. Both were great and the spring roll was really yummy. I ordered the Original Tonkutsu with the spice umami flavor booster. The flavor booster was a nice add in. The broth was sooo good. It was a thicker broth as opposed to the Tokyo Classic which is really light, but enjoyed it I loved the pork belly and everything in my ramen. My friends ordered the Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso and the Tokyo Classic Shoyu. They loved their ramen as well. 

The drinks. I was boring and got a regular glass of Cab. My friends ordered the Ryukyu Old Fashioned and the Shiso Perfect. All loved their cocktails. 

Wasabi is a definite return to. Loved this place. I would like to try their sushi next.

Love, love, love this place!  I can genuinely say they have the best Ramen in the city.  Usually a long wait but so worth it.

If you come after 7:00 p.m on any night (especially one with cold weather) you will likely have to wait.  Easy street parking on Milwaukee Ave.

My favorite items on the menu are the Brussel sprouts small plate.  Perfectly pout inducing (not sure if it's lemon or vinegar, but it's delicious!).  I love the spicy, garlic ramen.  The broth is so good and its clear that the chefs/cooks use high-quality food items to get the real deal taste.

On my third attempt to come here, I was severely turned off by the superiority complex of this spot.

We pulled up to ask the wait time on a Friday night, predicting something decent given it was the weekend, weather and overall vibe we could see from outside.

"One hour, forty five minutes. We will call your name."

Call my name ... out loud? Are you kidding me? You have the smallest, narrowest bar, NO waiting space near the hostess stand and expect us to stand around for the majority of a Michael Bay flick to hear our name being yelled out like it's the '90s?

Your ramen's good, but this setup is terrible. If you're going for a hipster trendy vibe, use technology like your target audience. The No Wait app is used by Au Cheval (best burger in America) and High Five (better ramen than yours) both use it, and are still incredibly successful.

I loved the ramen until I experienced this. What a turn off. We went elsewhere and spent about twice as much as we would've here but it was worth it.

This place is my girlfriend's favorite ramen place so we decided to come here last week. I have actually never had gourmet ramen before  as I have just had the instant ramen like back in college. 

We ordered Edamame and Pork Dumplings to start. The Edamame is just Edamame so obviously nothing special. The pork dumplings were weird as they were cut up into separate pieces; however, they were pretty good. I ordered the Spicy Roasted Garlic Miss and it was delicious! I love spicy food and will admit it had quite a punch of heat. My girlfriend ordered the Original Tonkotsu, which she has had before. 

Apparently, Wasabi just renovated their place separating their Sushi and Ramen restaurants. Wasabi Ramen was a sleek restaurant with a large communal table, separate tables, and bar. It was nice and everything, but I couldn't stand the house music in the background as I don't feel that it is fitting for a Japanese restaurant. It appears that the sushi restaurant is more traditional and Oriental. With that being said, I thought the ramen was delicious and I will definitely have to try it again!

Came by here for lunch on a weekday and it was pretty busy. There was plenty of street parking available. The restaurant is small and modern but welcoming. We were seated promptly but then there was the mystery of whether we had a server. He finally presented himself after about a 10 minute wait. We started with the gyoza which they say they make in house. It was very delicious. The dipping sauce was more vinegar than usual and made it stand out. I tried the tonkatsu ramen. The broth was super rich and savory. Overall it was a very good ramen but not the best I have had. I actually thought it was a little bit bland, so may consider adding the flavor booster option next time. The pork belly was some of the best I have ever had. Also the bamboo was very well prepared. Noodles were perfectly cooked. My husband had the hakata ramen. It was quite delicious. It was pretty spicy but not "face melting" as threatened by the menu. The biggest problems were with the service. I wasn't checked in on by the server until almost done with my meal. We also ordered hot tea which was a bit insulting- $3 for a tea bag in warm (not hot) water, and then had a hard time getting anyone to pour new water. 

Overall I would say the food is definitely worth coming for, but the service was really disappointing.

Wasabi offers one of the best broth in town. Yes, they've split the restaurant into two (their sister restaurant is Wasabi Sushi and Robota next door), and yes.. we may have awkwardly brought in our own wine and beer by accident (didn't get the memo about BYOB being cancelled) .. but overall, the decision to do so has cut down on waiting times (remember the old days with 1+ hour waits for two?) and was likely the smarter business choice, so that they may charge for alcohol.

We had the Spicy Tokyo Wings and Pork Belly Buns. Spicy Tokyo Wings definitely have a kick. They were well cooked, and the flavor had a darker flavor that reminded me a little of gochujang (Korean red chili paste). The pork belly in the Pork Belly Buns was cooked well. The buns were a fusion twist of the traditional gua bao (Taiwanese pork belly buns), and had the usual cilantro and pickled flavors replaced with blander flavors like lettuce and mayo. The garnish could have been better distributed with the meat, to help add more variety and flavors with each bite. Both sides were prepared well, but left something to be desired. If I were to order again, I would skip the Spicy Tokyo Wings.

My ramen, the Original Tonkotsu, was delicious. I am always a fan of their noodles, which have just the right level of chew and texture. The broth is the best in city so far for me- it is flavorful with pork and roasty, with a creamy finish (though, not as creamy as other locations). I had a sip of the Tokyo Classic Shoyu broth which was surprisingly light and packed with flavor, a great alternative for those looking for a less oily and heavy dish.

There are some things I do miss about the previous location. It's nice that we are no longer elbow to elbow and talking loudly over the room, and it has a brighter, more modern atmosphere compared to the previous feel of the restaurant, which felt more hole in the wall and grudgy with its dimmed lighting. The one thing I miss though is seeing the old Asian man stirring the gigantic pot of broth. That was a sight, and for some reason, made me feel like the broth you were getting was really legit.

We had an automatic 20% gratuity added for our party of five. Our waitress was attentive and thorough with going through the menu. For some odd reason, there was always a long line for the bathroom.

Overall, I love returning to Wasabi and its wonderful ramen. The BYOB and elements of the past atmosphere are missed.

Ramen Wasabi is quite yummy...I must admit. I like ramen and have gone to a couple of places around the city such as Furious Spoon and Ramen San, and I must say Wasabi is my fave. 

A few friends and I decided to go here before a show and it was a great decision. We got there right when they opened and people quickly filled in. So get here right when they open or you'll wait an hour for a table. 

Wasabi is a lively little space. Great music, nice decor, and jamming! I like how they keep the sushi restaurant separate but I don't think it would hurt if they knocked down the wall between the 2 to create more space. 

Our waitress was great. It took her a while to come, we figured they forgot about us since we were in the back of the restaurant, but she care eventually. She was very helpful with menu suggestions and explaining the tastes you would have with the ramen we were deciding between. 

Now on to the good stuff...THE FOOD! It was delicious. All four of us loved what we ordered. We started with the edamame and pork belly and kimchee spring roll. We were going to get the slider, but our waitress advised not too. She said it's only 1 slider per order so it wouldn't have been worth it for the 4 of us to order. So we passed on that and went for the spring rolls, which she said were good. Both were great and the spring roll was really yummy. I ordered the Original Tonkutsu with the spice umami flavor booster. The flavor booster was a nice add in. The broth was sooo good. It was a thicker broth as opposed to the Tokyo Classic which is really light, but enjoyed it I loved the pork belly and everything in my ramen. My friends ordered the Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso and the Tokyo Classic Shoyu. They loved their ramen as well. 

The drinks. I was boring and got a regular glass of Cab. My friends ordered the Ryukyu Old Fashioned and the Shiso Perfect. All loved their cocktails. 

Wasabi is a definite return to. Loved this place. I would like to try their sushi next.

Wow, I've tried plenty of ramen joints in NYC, and this place beats anything I've ever had in the US! I've tried the Hakata original and the Miso Garlic, thus far, both are amazing. Their pork belly is exquisitely cooked to perfection, soft boiled eggs can't get any better, and the noodles have the perfect "QQ" consistency. Their spice level will challenge anyone, because you can ask for a side of chili oil (don't underestimate it, it builds!)
Wait times can be pretty bad because it's small, and they won't seat you until all/most of your party is present. Large groups will be tough, looks like the easiest way to get in is 1-2 people They only have 1 table that seats 6, if you want to try that strategy! 
I was heartbroken to find out there aren't lunch special prices, so you know this place is busy enough they don't need to cut their lunch menu prices, can't recommend highly enough!

I have now been back since the restaurant expanded and separated into the sushi bar and ramen restaurant. We came for lunch and had about a 15 minute wait at 1pm for the ramen spot.

The ramen wasabi is not byob (only sushi side we were told). My husband had a nice beer that was delicious and reasonable. I had a glass of prosecco. It was so small that I was like looking for the rest of it. I'd skip the expensive wine/cocktails and stick with food.

The food was tasty. Ramen was excellent as before. We also ordered a slider each and a special uni dish. While the uni itself was delicious and fresh, I otherwise thought the dish was just pretty basic. The sliders were delicious. 

Service was just ok. While friendly, it was very slow. They clearly were overworked and needed more help. It is also frustrating to see people who arrived after you getting their food first. Others at the communal table seemed to be having similar issues. One person didn't get their drink until they almost finished their ramen. 

Overall, I will go back for the Ramen. However, I do miss the option of being able to order sushi along with the hot menu.

I've passed Wasabi so many times, so it was nice to get the chance to stop by for lunch recently.  Wasabi is split into two different areas (with two different entrances as well).  The original Wasabi space is open for dinner, and mostly focuses on sushi and other dishes.  The original wasabi area is BYOB, while the newer side has alcoholic beverages available for purchase.  The newer Wasabi area is open for lunch (on the weekend) and dinner (Tues-Sunday).  The newer Wasabi includes a menu focused more on the ramen, rice bowls, and appetizers.  

I ordered the Tokyo Classic Shoyu ramen.  This ramen dish is chicken broth based, and has a nice variety of veggies in it.  I liked my ramen, but I enjoyed the taste of the Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso better (my boyfriend ordered this one).  Personally, I think I enjoy the taste of pork broth based ramen's better than chicken broth based ones.  If you like mild and light, then the Tokyo Classic Shoyu ramen would be a better choice for you.  I thought that the size of the ramen bowls were reasonably sized, but I think it would be great if they added a little bit more meat in the ramen bowls.  My bowl only had two cubes of meat, and I found this skimpy compared to other ramen restaurants that I've tried in Chicago.

One of the best ramen places in the city! For Sure!

Came here on a cold winter night, and the weather was definitely perfect for ramen!
Despite the wait time, we were seated at the bar, ordering sushi roll, pork belly buns, and two bowls of ramen!

The classic tonkotsu was rich in flavors and the runny egg was so dreamy! Noodles were nice and chewy, just the way I prefer.

Pork belly buns were seasoned and steamed to perfection, and my mouth still waters as I think about them!

I've been meaning to find to come back ever since! 5/5!! :)

Showed up on a Thursday with a party of 2. They said the wait was going to be around 45 minutes but ended up only being around 30. They don't offer NoWait or take your number so you'll have to stick close. Luckily I did! We were sat at a table in the back near the restrooms. To confirm what other yelpers have stayed, the tables near the windows are definitely colder so be sure to layer on a sweater. We decided to go with the crispy brussel sprouts to start and we're not disappointed. Crispy and with just enough of this balsamic (?) sauce to provide the perfect flavor. I went with the Tonkotsu with the flavor enhancer. My guest went with the spicy miso garlic ramen. While both were good, the slicy miso garlic ramen was amazing. The closest ramen in overall quality to High Five's signature bowl that I've had thus far during my ramen journey through Chicago. The broth was perfectly thick and spicy, the noodles a nice girth, and the marinated pork was delicous and flavorful. The Tonkotsu was good as well, don't get me wrong, but paled in comparison. Go with a friend so you can try both and split them but I bet you'll both agree that next time you're only getting the spicy miso garlic!

I haven't been to Wasabi in a long time, but I heard that they just made a new expansion between sushi and ramen. Though I am not a huge fan between the separation of the two restaurants. Sometimes I just want both!

Ramen has been my go to for comfort food for some odd reason. My ramen was flavorful especially the broth! I had my share of gelatin like broth, but this one was smooth. 

I would definitely come back and try their other ramen noodles.

Absolutely the best ramen I've had in the Midwest. 

Came on a Sunday at 6:30pm and the wait is absolutely insane. We waited for an hour for a table for two. The waiting area is relatively small so most people wait and chat outside. Don't know what's gonna happen when winter hits... The decor inside is very modern, and not very traditional Japanese. But I like it. It's a very classy environment. 

We each ordered the original Tonkotsu ramen and shared the pork belly buns. Again we wait for maybe 15-20 mins for the food to come out. The pork belly buns came in twos. Literally, the braised pork belly melts when it enters the mouth. The organic romaine, sesame mayo, and the scallions compliment the buns super well. Onto the ramen, it was simply AMAZING! The best ramen I've had in Chicago. The broth tasted so delicious, and the pork belly was again amazing. The soft boiled egg is on point and the ramen is cooked just to al dente. We finished the entire bowl in under 5 minutes. I was tempted to get a second bowl... 

Overall this is the best bowl of ramen I've had in the five years that I'm in the Midwest. It's almost on par with the ramen in Sawtelle, LA, and I would definitely frequent here.

I had been wondering what the new space next to Wasabi was all about.  They expanded! However, the new space is a Noodle shop, which still features their outstanding Tonkotsu Ramen. And they have a liquor license.  The problem is, if you want Sushi or their wonderful Teriyaki Steak Skewers (or their steak entree) you have to go to their original location - where you cannot get ramen, and it is still BYOB.

Wasabi needed to expand- but splitting the menu between the two locations is a bad idea in my opinion.  Our server was horrid, she did not explain what was going in the new space, and when I asked for the Skewer appetizer she said you had to get that next door- but didn't offer any other suggestions instead. Lame.

The food is still great, but I may not go back until they work our their menu.  If we want both ramen and sushi - or steak - I have no intention of either visiting both places or splitting up my dining party.

I have done a pretty full tour of ramen joints in Chicago and time and time again Wasabi has topped my list of best ramen in Chicago. In a category with highly touted heavyweights such as high five ramen and slurping turtle, I still find that the noodles at wasabi separate them from the pack. I take my ramen pretty seriously as it's one of the dishes I enjoy eating the most. 

I believe ramen needs to be assessed in a variety of categories (e.g., soup/broth flavor, consistency, accompanying ingredients, golden egg, temperature) but overall, I think the noodle quality in the chew and texture is should be the most heavily weighted criteria in a ramen assessment. Others may disagree and I can see how the soup/broth needs to be of extreme importance as it's one of the things that many places pride themselves on... but wasabi gets 5 stars for their noodles. Their tonkatsu broth is quite good and all of the accompanying items added great flavor - definitely add the kakuni (I know $4 upcharge is steep - but it's worth it). 

Still, it's the wavy noodles and the way it picks up the flavor of the broth and has outstanding mouth feel that makes this a consistent and regular destination for me in Chicago. Their recent expansion makes it much easier to get seating than before and while I definitely will continue to try the new ramen shops to see whether any can challenge Wasabi's ramen-champion status in my mind - it's been years and nothing has been able to unseat this king.

Bottom line - if you want ramen - Wasabi is worth the trip to wicker park for what I honestly believe is the best representation of ramen in the city.

A friend of mine told me about Wasabi, and said it was her favorite ramen spot in Chicago. Seeing as how I've had ramen at several spots in Chicago, and I just wasn't a huge fan, I didn't have the highest hopes for Wasabi. But now that I've been here, I can say that this will become my go-to spot for ramen in Chicago!

We stopped by at around 8:30pm on a weekday night and it was pretty packed. We did get seated about 10 minutes later at the counter. I don't know if I would recommend that because it was pretty hot sitting next to the kitchen.

We ordered:
+Pork Belly Buns ($8): the buns were fluffy, the meat was tender, and the sauce was flavorful. They did. Good job with these buns. Highly recommend these, especially if you've never had one before!
+Tonkotsu Ramen ($13): I really don't know how they did it, but they managed to make a broth that was flavorful without being overly rich or salty. One of the better ramens I have ever had (not just Chicago)! Everything about this was just good.
+Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso Ramen ($14): I didn't taste it, but the bf said that this was actually too spicy for him and that he liked my ramen better.

I enjoyed my meal here so much that I almost came again a few days later. Alas I didn't, but I have been telling people about the great ramen I had. Definitely hitting up this spot next time I'm in Chicago again.

The food was on par with good ramen places around the city. But go to Kizuki Ramen instead.

Service was very slow; we got served after other groups that arrived before us. We waited 20-30 minutes after ordering, at which point the waitress came and said that an appetizer was taking longer and they would bring out the ramen first. But the ramen didn't come, and we waited another 10 minutes, when that appetizer came out. And then another 5-10 for the ramen... But only 3 came. Then the 4th came a minute later, and it was another 5-10 for the 5th item.

Water refill was also slow and the windows have no shades, so half of our group sitting in direct sun was sweating before starting to eat.

To top it off, they charged a mandatory gratuity of 20% for a group of 5 - awfully high percentage for that kind of service, and 5 is not a large group.

I went to Ramen Wasabi for the first time, this past Friday, for dinner. We waited almost an hour to get a table for four people. The place was packed...for good reason. The food was amazing and well worth the wait.

They make all of their Ramen using a Berkshire pork bone broth. People love it. As a vegetarian, I'm happy that they also have vegan/vegetarian options. I went with the vegan ta tan men (vegan ramen). It's made with seaweed broth and I chose with the buckwheat noodles versus the egg noodles. It was extremely flavorful.

Their drinks are great, too. They have the requisite sake and Japanese whiskey. But their house cocktails are creative and delicious. I tried the "Whisper of The Heart" which had gin, green tea and a bunch of other tasty ingredients. The other drinks were greatly received, too.

I highly recommend this place. Note that there is a BYOB Wasabi restaurant that they split off, next door.

Grabbed dinner here on a Sunday afternoon after a show at Timeline Theater. The 5 of us were immediately seated and given our choice seating by the large front windows, providing plenty of natural light to our table.  

This place is BYOB (unlike their sister restaurant on the corner which specializes in ramen) so grab some wine across the street and be merry.

We ordered starters, skewers, and sushi which perfectly filled our party of five. Unfortunately they were out of THREE different things we ordered and offered no explanation except general apologies. This wasn't a big deal, just a warning if you're a picky eater looking for something in particular. 

The calamari balls are NOT TO BE MISSED. Our other favorites were the eggplant skewer, the pork bun tacos, and the surf &a turf sushi roll. 

PROS: fast seating, BYOB, lots of variety in dishes and styles of food 

CONS: out of a surprising number of very different things

My last meal in Chicago was one of the best ones during my trip. I visited on a Saturday night and expected a wait, but told the hostess that first available seating would be perfectly fine. A 45-minute wait turned into a 30-minute one, and I was so excited to get right into it.

The food at Wasabi is excellent. I tried a combination of the tonkotsu ramen, nigiri, and the Mag Mile roll. Every item receives 5 stars from me. The service was also top notch. Ramen and sushi lovers alike need to make Wasabi a priority to visit. 

Highlights:
-Tonkotsu ramen ($13): Get this with the torched pork. It's a few dollars extra but well worth it. The pork melts in your mouth and when I say melts it /meeellltttsss/. The broth is incredibly rich, but not to the point that it's overwhelming. It's actually quite perfect. The noodles were also excellent. This ramen was just perfect.

-Otoro nigiri (m/p): I've never had otoro nigiri before, and I wanted to cry because where had it been all my life?! I know not many restaurants carry it, so there's more reason to cry there. It was the single best-tasting fish of my life.

-Kani nigiri ($4): ACTUAl crab. Not KRAB.

-Mag Mile roll ($15): The combination of spicy octopus and seared tuna is one that should be used more often. I think the tuna needs to be a little more seared for this roll.

Awesome ramen!  We all had the classic tonkatsu, and it was just perfect.  Huge portions, super tasty, perfect pork, perfect egg, perfect noodles.  It's also BYOB, which I think just adds to it being such a fun experience.  Really friendly staff, too.

This is by far my favorite ramen spot in the city! I typically get the tonkotsu ramen, broth is rich and tasty. This place differs from other ramen spots I've been to- the broth is so well-made that I don't believe they use a lot of seasonings. I went on a weekday, right when they opened, the wait was about 20-30 minutes, I'm sure on the weekend it is a lot longer. This place is a must if you're a ramen snob!!

Waaaaaats up Wasabi! So good... loved it! I've always been wanting to try this trendy-looking spot and it did not disappoint. The line was pretty long, but it was worth the wait. You can't go wrong with any of the ramen, as most had delicious pork belly, but I went ahead and ordered the "Original Tonkotsu", which had the Berkshire pork belly, soft boiled egg (a must!), bamboo shoots, scallions, sesame, mushrooms, and swimming in a oh-my-god-so-good broth. That broth.... wow.

Service was good, food was good, ambiance was good. Yay! I'm a fan, for sure.


BATHROOM REVIEW: As like the restaurant, the line was long for the single stall bathroom for the dudes. I.... actually didn't get a chance to use it. Womp womp. No bathroom review this time.

This is one of the better ramen shops that I've tried in the city. The tonkotsu broth is the highlight, tastes very smooth and fragrant. The pork is very tender and seasoned perfectly, but the cut was a bit too fatty for my liking. Their portions are on the smaller side, so I recommend getting an appetizer too if you're hungry. I really enjoyed the egg with the slightly runny yolk, I just wish they gave a whole egg instead of half.

A friend of mine told me about Wasabi, and said it was her favorite ramen spot in Chicago. Seeing as how I've had ramen at several spots in Chicago, and I just wasn't a huge fan, I didn't have the highest hopes for Wasabi. But now that I've been here, I can say that this will become my go-to spot for ramen in Chicago!

We stopped by at around 8:30pm on a weekday night and it was pretty packed. We did get seated about 10 minutes later at the counter. I don't know if I would recommend that because it was pretty hot sitting next to the kitchen.

We ordered:
+Pork Belly Buns ($8): the buns were fluffy, the meat was tender, and the sauce was flavorful. They did. Good job with these buns. Highly recommend these, especially if you've never had one before!
+Tonkotsu Ramen ($13): I really don't know how they did it, but they managed to make a broth that was flavorful without being overly rich or salty. One of the better ramens I have ever had (not just Chicago)! Everything about this was just good.
+Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso Ramen ($14): I didn't taste it, but the bf said that this was actually too spicy for him and that he liked my ramen better.

I enjoyed my meal here so much that I almost came again a few days later. Alas I didn't, but I have been telling people about the great ramen I had. Definitely hitting up this spot next time I'm in Chicago again.

The food was on par with good ramen places around the city. But go to Kizuki Ramen instead.

Service was very slow; we got served after other groups that arrived before us. We waited 20-30 minutes after ordering, at which point the waitress came and said that an appetizer was taking longer and they would bring out the ramen first. But the ramen didn't come, and we waited another 10 minutes, when that appetizer came out. And then another 5-10 for the ramen... But only 3 came. Then the 4th came a minute later, and it was another 5-10 for the 5th item.

Water refill was also slow and the windows have no shades, so half of our group sitting in direct sun was sweating before starting to eat.

To top it off, they charged a mandatory gratuity of 20% for a group of 5 - awfully high percentage for that kind of service, and 5 is not a large group.

You can always count on a good bowl of ramen to boost your mood -- and Wasabi delivers that, no doubt! 

A few months ago, my friend and I found a small San Fran ramen joint that served the best ramen I've ever had. Every ramen that followed just seemed weak in comparison...until today. 

I ordered the spicy roasted garlic miso ramen. Delicious, rich broth with just the right amount of savory and creaminess. The spice is subtle at first, but a few slurps and bites in, it'll kick in (especially if you were downing that bowl as fast as I was). Noodles were cooked perfectly and had a good bite. Toppings are simple and compliment the noodles well, too. My one critique would be that I've had more meat without having to pay extra at other places, but the meat was bomb, I can't deny that. 

My friends also got the shoyu ramen and original tonkotsu. No complaints there! 

Staff was friendly and service was pretty fast. We came around 1:30pm and managed to snag a table for 6 with only about a 10 minute wait. Keep an eye out for the hours since they close mid-day and re-open at night. 

Thanks for the good food and vibes, Wasabi. Can't wait to eat here again soon!

Apparently they recently separated the ramen side from the sushi side, which was disappointing because it would have been great to have both! Or at least cross order on the menu. 

I've been on a bit of a ramen kick lately, sampling the goodies from Ivan Ramen, Momofuku Noodle Bar, Ippudo, and now Wasabi. While they all have interesting and somewhat similar fusion-y menus, I think Wasabi is probably middle of the pack. The pork bun was oversauced to the point where you couldn't really pick it up and kind of fell apart. The special was an uni and tuna bowl with quail egg which sounds great in theory but was ok. I liked the uni but the tuna tasteless in comparison. As for the main reason to visit - the ramen was good, not mind blowing but good enough. Tonkatsu broth was rich and flavorful and the chicken ramen was as described "like a more flavorful chicken noodle soup". It was filled at 5:30 on a Saturday (albeit a lot families) so it must be popular with locals!

Worth. Came on a Saturday night and was told that the wait would be an hour for our table of 3. We only ended up waiting for about 45 minutes. Within 2 minutes of being seated, they brought us water. The waiter gave us about 5 minutes to look over the menu and asked us if we had any questions and took our order. 

I ordered the yakitori (did not appear on the menu but was on a special menu that we didnt see?) and miso ramen. The yakitori came in this paper container, something that you'd get at a fair, which was odd but easily overlooked once you tasted the food. The miso ramen came shortly after and was absolutely delicious. The noodles weren't overcooked and the soup wasn't too salty (both which I experience often). The bamboo shoots were a nice addition. 

Overall a great experience. Food was super tasty and service wasn't too pushy but was present and helpful. The setting inside was super cute and everything looked like it was made out of wood. Only con would be that it was a tad too dark.  Would recommend and would come back!! BYOB btw.

Before coming to Wasabi, I had heard it was the best ramen in the city. So I was surprised to find they had a very extensive menu - and let me tell you, everything we ate (ok, devoured) was delicious. I can't wait to come back and try more! Next up will be sushi, skewers, and more small plates if I can fit them all in my belly. 

This time we started with the edamame and brussel sprouts as our appetizers (both recommended). Then we each ordered our own ramen bowls, which was more than enough food. I tried the tonkotsu ramen and was very pleased indeed. Everything from the broth to the noodles to the pork to the bamboo shoots was totally on point. And of course we washed it all down with some BYOB beer - no corkage fee! So clutch. 
But because Wasabi is clearly so BA, there will likely be a wait. Our party of three waited a bit longer than parties of two (seemed to move quickly) and once we were inside, the service was great and the food came out ridiculously fast. So brave the wait - it's worth it!

Enjoyed a great lunch last week with my daughters at Wasabi. Since they're both college students I figured their taste for good "ramen" might be satisfied. 

Located right on the northeast corner parking was available on the street. The restaurant was laid out nicely with a modern motif. The clientele varied but were mostly millennials.

We all decided to go for the "Tonkotsu" they call the original. Though the place had a good crowd the wait was  fairly short. The dish consisted of Berkshire pork belly, a soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, scallions, sesame, Blackwood ear mushrooms and garlic oil.

There were plenty of options on the menu and of course a couple of spicy ones. I'll definitely return again. Wasabi is a great alternative and brings great redemption to the word, "ramen".

Quick and easy process and this may sound trivial but the fact they offer MEXICAN BOTTLED COKE made my whole experience much better. I wanted soda with my food and I saw the $2 price tag... thinking "if it's canned who cares"

I was wrong and I got the bottled stuff! Happy!

Popped in here Saturday night after a visit to Humboldt Park. My boyfriend and I had both had this place bookmarked forever! We were lucky to only wait 10 minutes (even though they quoted us 30-45 minutes wait). We were very impressed from the get go. Our waiter gave us really good advice on what was popular, what they were known for and some of his personal favorite dishes.

We started out with the pork sliders and my boyfriend really wanted to get another order. The pork was charred and the buns were served almost like a taco instead of a sandwich. 10/10

We then got the Brussels sprouts that our waiter recommended. Woah. I compared them to vegetable candy. We almost licked our bowl!

We both got separate orders of the Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso. This cleared my sinuses- in a great way. Fantastic ramen!

Great vibes, great service and great food. We will definitely be back!

Came here for lunch at 11.30am on a Saturday and there were open tables with no wait. Tried the Spicy Roasted Garlic Ramen and the Pork Belly Buns. Food came out incredibly quickly.

Pork Belly Buns- Two open faced Bao Buns per order with two pieces of well marinate Pork Belly, lettuce, and spicy mayo on the bottom. Meat was flavorful and not too fatty which is how I like it. Would prefer different greens than lettuce to be honest. Spicy mayo was a good touch to being the dish together. Three stars for this dish. Overall, the ones from Momofuku in NYC and and the Bun Shop in LA were slightly better!

Spicy Roasted Garlic Ramen - Noodles were so so, came with two pieces of pork, half a ramen-style egg, lots of bamboo and bean sprouts. Really appreciated how the broth wasn't overly salty. But being that the Noodle should be the star of the dish, was hoping for better texture. Still very enjoyable overall. Three stars for this dish as well.

Took my hubby there for his birthday! Great experience and food overall! Nice and cozy spot with choice of sushi and ramen (we had veggie ramen! Loved it) as a part of the menu. 
Staff was very pleasant and helpful. My husband ordered pork ramen against my suggestion (he's not a pork person at all, trust me) and his server had no problem replacing it with vegetarian one. 
BYOB is a great plus to this place! 
The only minus was a 45min wait on Tuesday night...

I've been coming to Wasabi for a while now and I always like recommending the place. Wasabi is a great place to go with a group of friends! I like the fact that they accommodate to large groups without feeling like a sardine. So with that said, I totally recommend this place for a nice date for two and for meeting a group. I came in last night (Tuesday) for dinner and waited about 10 minutes for a table for 5. It was nice when we were seated that our table was spacious, we like to over order and have enough space to enjoy every dish!

The atmosphere is great, it's trendy, a bit dark, and at times it can get a little loud - no complaints though. The staff is welcoming and super friendly, everyone I came across made eye contact, smiled, and some stopped to check on how our table was doing. Our server was a sweetheart, he definitely made ordering easy and totally accommodated and handled our large group well! There were no mix ups and every plate came out as we asked! 

The food was great. Everyone enjoyed their meals and we had a good time. I should mention that there was one issue with one of the Entrees. Everyone had their dishes and she waited a little longer on account to a kitchen issue -- which was brought to our attention. Luckily my girlfriend is a patient girl, she didn't mind at all. Our appetizers were great for sharing! The ramen was very filling, the sushi was fresh, and the dessert was a great way to end the night!

Definitely recommend checking this place out!

Not my favorite ramen but definitely not bad. It was good and so were the appetizers but nothing was particularly special or stood out. I would definitely go back if a friend asked me to but wouldn't go out of my way. However, they do have a sister restaurant next door that serves sushi and I would love to try that next.

I'm very conflicted in writing this review. And also somewhat confused. Conflicted because the food I ordered when I checked in was really good but the service was absolutely terrible. Confused because there are two Wasabi's on this block and unsure if they're together or separate entities. This review is for the Wasabi with the entrance on the corner. 

I went there alone late at night and just really needed food. They sat me right away which was great. But after that, it was a very frustrating experience. I wasn't greeted by anyone for at least 10 mins until someone notice that it looked like I haven't been helped. He asked if I was helped yet and I said 'no'. A few minutes later he brought me water, but still no sign of the waitress. Everyone around me seemed antsy as well waiting to place orders. The table next to me seemed to be waiting even longer than I was since they were there before me and didn't see the waitress until I did. 

Finally the waitress came. She took the order of the table next to me and I ordered my food right away. It took 20 mins for my food to arrive which seemed to be longer than it should have for a bowl of rice and beef, but I could be wrong. The whole vibe of the restaurant seemed off (at least for that night) because as I sat there waiting to order/for my food everyone looked annoyed and antsy. 

Food finally arrived, I downed it, it was delicious, and as soon as I saw the waitress again (her appearances were scarce) I asked for the check. I got the waygu beef bowl. It was a lot smaller than I had expected, but the meat was well marinated with good flavor. It came pipping hot so I kept having to air out the steam to eat it. Just what I needed.

I don't know if it's the 1 hour wait while watching people slurp noodles through the glass window, or the flavorful broth and tender pork...but this place was one of my top ramen experiences ever.  The broth was rich, but not heavy and it didn't leave this thirsty feeling I usually get after eating ramen.  yummm- worth the wait!

This is the best ramen I've ever had. There's something about the broth that is magical. It's the ultimate comfort food, it's profoundly satisfying, and it always hits the spot. Also the pork rolls are like little puffy clouds. The place is usually packed and has weird hours but honestly it is all worth it and I am more than willing to plan my day around it.

This is my favorite place to get ramen in Chicago! You can tell that the broth was prepared many hours in advance due to how rich and creamy it is. I can't emphasize just how good it is! The noodles are the traditional alkaline noodles that I think many of the ramen shops here in Chicago purchase from. The classic tonkatsu ramen is my favorite and the meat is really tasty. Wasabi also has a sushi shop a block north of their ramen location (the original Wasabi building), and it's a great place to get a quick appetizer while you wait to get a seat (there's usually a wait during peak dining hours). I've never been particularly impressed by the non-sushi appetizers, but the main star is the ramen and it's really evident that a lot of time and care goes into its preparation.

AMAZING ramen! I had the vegan ramen sans the seitan (not everything needs a meat replacement...just add more veggies) and it was delicious! I personally would definitely come back, but the rest of my family I'm not so sure considering we had to wait over an hour to be seated and then had to wait again once seated because of slow service....If you plan on coming here definitely plan to come right when they open or after 9pm (no matter what day of the week because we had to wait long on a Tuesday). Now if you don't want to wait a minimum of 30 min, then go to Wasabi Sushi next door. The sushi is okay, but nothing to rave over. Especially since the rolls were very small. 

Wasabi, PLEASE allow reservations! At minimum, please come up with a new host stand system that will allow customers to put their name on the list and then have the host text or call them when their table ready. No one wants to stand outside for an 1 hour +. Especially when it's bad weather outside.

Taking my wife to her favorite Ramen spot for her birthday. Walk up to Wasabi, note on door reads along the lines of "If you want Ramen, go next door to Wasabi Ramen, NO BYOB! If you want sushi, enter, BYOB."  Bummer.  It was a Friday, and I spent my lunch break rushing a local microbrewery to pick up a $15 bomber of an bourbon barrel aged imperial porter, only to be denied the privilege of BYOB. Very un-Chicago. I am definitely salty after being so excited for this limited edition beverage. When we were seated I ordered a spiteful $4 PBR. To the left and right of us were 2 other tables equally disappointed in the non-BYOB switch-a-roo.  Thumbs up to the owners who are going to make a lot more money with liquor sales! 

The new location is contemporary and trendy, and the food is good. They may have more ramen offerings, I wasn't really looking as I was not in the mood for ramen on an 85 degree day. The popcorn chicken app was not nearly as good as other Asian places with the same (or better) deep fry recipe. The octopus balls were on point just like at Wasabi classic.  I had several fish scales in my Tuna Poke Bowl. Gross having to pick them out of your mouth. 

It is ultimately disappointing you have to choose between the 2 locations. Insult to injury that one of them is not BYO, but hopefully it will easier to get seated because of these changes.

My boyfriend and I heard great things about this place, so we had to give it a shot! We came around 8:30PM-9:00PM on a Friday night. It was pretty chilly outside so we had to get ramen. The hostess said we'd wait about 45 minutes to an hour but we ended up waiting for less than 45 minutes. I was wondering why there was still a wait for such a late time, but I realized that they have BYOB. That's why it was so packed.

We sat at the bar, all cramped up. The service was a bit slow in the beginning because it was so packed, but it picked-up once we started ordering our food. Both of us ordered the spicy roasted garlic miso ramen. The broth was incredible. It was the perfect amount of spice! The noodles were yummy, but the pork belly was disappointing. It was kind of tough, and not soft at all. I would rate this place 3.5 stars if I could. 

Would I come back? Maybe.

Wasabi and its sister restaurant, Ramen Takeya are my favorite ramen joints in Chicago!

I got the spicy roasted garlic miso ramen both times and it was consistently good! It wasn't too spicy, but definitely enough so to make you reach for some water. I actually prefer this over the spicy miso ramen at Ramen Takeya.

Their sushi and yakitori are actually pretty solid too - but I come here solely for their ramen :)

Wasabi was bookmarked on my list for months and folks, all the positive 4-5 star reviews are true. Wasabi knocks it out of the ballpark when it comes to delivering amazing ramen. So far, this is the best ramen I've ever had! 

Our group of 3 arrived on a Saturday during lunch hour and my friend, her husband, and I ordered a Beef udon soup, Sushi lunch special and the Tonkatsu ramen. I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen and it was perfection. The broth is what makes this dish. The broth has a rich pork flavor and the Berkshire pork belly was phenomenal. When I think of pork belly, I think of fatty, gelatinous, rubber with a side chunk of meat. I prefer eating lean meats and fatty, cartilaginous meat is not to my liking. I just can't get over the rubbery texture. 

This pork belly was different. It was fatty, but very soft and tender. I ate it all! Pair it with some amazing broth and you have perfection in a bowl. I finished it all in one sitting with no leftovers to take home and no shame because of it. It was that good.

I enjoyed the modern minimalist decor. Our server was prompt and friendly. Arrive early and with a full party. They will not seat your party at their tables until all are present. Street parking is available, but use the side streets to avoid the meters.

It was a good experience, but I've had better. We had: edamame, Kara age, original, shoyu, and sake. The apps were typical of any ramen house. The broth could be more flavorful. I was surprised that an extra half egg was $1! I've been to places where you'd get the whole egg. The sake selection was extremely scarce. Overall, it satisfied my desire for ramen on chilly Chicago day.

They've remodeled since the last time I was here - there's now a more modern-looking lunch and cocktail section in addition to the original place (which is now just for dinner). To my friend and I's initial disappointment, the lunch area is no longer BYOB. However, after starting to dig into our ramen, we quickly forgot about that and spent the next 20 minutes slurping our entire bowls clean. I had the original tonkatsu ramen, which was incredibly creamy and flavorful. The noodles were nice and firm, the egg yolk was runny yet still held its shape, and the pork fell apart perfectly. I'll definitely be ordering it again in the future.

Though the service was pretty average, I'd highly recommend paying Wasabi a visit. The modern restaurant atmosphere coupled with the delicious, well-priced food will make it a worthwhile experience.

Came here because we wanted to have some really good ramen, and that's just what we found! When we got there, it was super packed. The wait was about 45 min, so we put our name down and saw that it was BYOB without any fees. We ran over to the CVS across the street to purchase some drinks to enjoy with dinner. 

Our order consisted of Oyster shooters and Uni shooters to start, followed by their fried chicken drumsticks and a couple sushi pieces, then Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso Ramen. The Oyster and Uni shooters were delicious and fresh. I wanted to order more, but I didn't want to be unable to finish my food. The fried chicken was great, and the sauce it came with only enhanced it. The Ramen was the perfect amount of spicy for me, and the flavor didn't disappoint. I've tried a lot of different Ramen places, and this place makes it to the higher end of my list.

One of my favorite ramen places in the city. 

I've been here before and decided to take my fianc there. We ordered the original tantanmen ramen. The broth is light but flavorful. The noodles were cooked to perfection and not overdone. We like to add hot chili oil to the broth to make it spicy, and even without that, the broth is delicious. 

The reason for the four stars is because they don't serve enough pork in their ramen. I barely got three bites and so did my fianc. 

They have expanded and now serve ramen on the corner and sushi in the original spot next door.

I've been to Wasabi probably about three dozen times over the last two years, because I think they have the most authentic Hakata style ramen in Chicago. However, their sushi is mediocre at best, so I can't give them more than three stars overall. The last time I had their daily special O Toro sashimi ($8 for one piece) which wasn't fresh and a very poor quality cut to begin with. Uni shooter was probably one of the worst things I've ever had. If I had to drink from a swamp, I'm certain it would taste and smell like the uni shooter they served me. Long story short, get ramen, but skip anything involving raw fish.

If I had to drink from a swamp, I'm certain it would taste and smell like the uni shooter they served me. Long story short, get ramen, but skip anything involving raw fish.

-- Tonkatsu Ramen + Torched Pork Belly (x2)

[ Ambiance ]
-- Heard it gets pretty crowded so we went right at 11am on a Saturday
-- BYOB so we walked to CVS down the street and got a 6pack
-- No problem getting seated, started to get more crowded by noon when we left
-- Options of sushi bar, booth or table
-- Super nice staff and attentive waitress

-- Street parking, though there was also a CVS right down the street that you may be able to park in (not sure)

[ Size ]
-- 2 adults

[ Cost ] incl. tax & tip
-- $46

Pretty good flavor ramen, but the TORCHED PORK BELLY was a must!  Would have tried the Spicy Garlic Miso Ramen, but since it was my first time, I usually try and compare the tonkatsu ramen.  The large wooden spoon is a nice touch and the ramen noodles were pretty spot on!  Would definitely come back, but also wondering if I am a bit biased since this seems to be the only ramen spot around...

The wait here can get long especially if you're a bigger party and it's freezing outside in the middle of December. For a party of five, we had a 40-minute wait and since the restaurant is small, there really isn't anywhere you can stand to wait inside. There's an outside waiting area with a rooftop that can fit maybe 10 people at max. It really needs a heater because you might as well be standing in the cold. Speaking of a party of five, you would be charged 20% gratuity for parties of five or more. Yikes! I only usually see 18% so 20% was a bit much. 

They offer BYOB which means you can bring your own booze to Wasabi. They limit it to your own wine or two cans of beer per person but no hard liquor. That's a pretty nice option seeing as alcohol at restaurants can be a bit pricey and there's a CVS just down the block if you wish to grab a six-pack of your own.

TONKOTSU RAMEN
This is probably the best ramen in town Chicago-wise. I thought it was very good although the broth and ramen was not the standout to me. My ramen seemed to be completely covered with a lot of scallions. But what blew my mind was the pork belly. PORK BELLY HEAVEN, it was fatty and tender and super delicious. It made me wish I tried the pork belly buns. As for the broth, I think I do prefer spicy broths since I tasted my friend's dish which was the spicy garlic miso ramen.

Could it be???? 

Could the on-going chase, forever quest, serious search, witch hunt for silky and rich ramen be over? This desire for ramen goes deep...likely to fly to Tokyo just so I can devour that porky Tonkotsu broth this moment, deep. 

So finally, literally, after 4 years of trying to get here - the husband and I made serious plans to meet in Logan Square for ramen, Wasabi to be clear (not tonkotsu of me at all). 

Lots of available seating at 5:30 :) Window benches, booths and 2 seater tables. I think I even saw space at the kitchen counter. Lots of people with BYOB - but for us there's no need. This vessel need not be filled with any other liquid. 

Okay lets discuss ingredients. From my knowledge they cook their broth for a decent amount of time, letting that gelatinous goodness break down. (thank you). In my opinion it was lacking a little bit of depth - I like to be pork punched. Second disappointment was that I couldn't order my noodles, which is a little firmer than most. (theirs come el dente), so these were a little softer than i prefer. Third, I find the best pork bowls have thinner cut of chashu - Wasabi's was seriously thick. But all in all a decent bowl of ramen. That egg was incredible and I loved the toppings on my bowl!! 

Could you guys put chili oil or paste on the tables for those who like a little bit of punch??

Would also love to see a ground pork miso option

Will certainly come back to try the other variations.

Here's the deal. This place, for me, has lost a star, even though my service and food experience were improved this time around. HOWEVER, I had to agree to eat ramen, because now, they've turned the restaurant into two separate places; one which only has sushi and main entrees, one which only has ramen. I WANTED THE STEAK WITH ASPARAGUS, MY GIRLFRIEND HAD HER HEART SET ON RAMEN. My friend won this round, because it was her suggestion we eat there, and it was because she was craving ramen. While my ramen was delicious, I had literally been looking forward to their teriyaki steak and asparagus for days, only to discover at the door that it was one or the other. My friend even almost just went next door with me to give me what I wanted, but I wasn't ok with letting that happen. Until they can figure out how to make it an all-in-one type of place where I can order a hot dish AND my friends can have their ramen, lest I too, am craving ramen, there are plenty of places where the whole menu can fit in one room. Hit me up when that's the case here.

I love the spicy roasted garlic ramen so much. My husband and I went to Wasabi on our first date together and we've been at least 20 times since. I preferred the flexibility of the original location because you could also get sushi and one of my faves was the hamachi collar but truth be told I usually just get the ramen on its own. I liked the BYOB aspect of the original location and I haves mixed feelings about the cocktails. The old fashioned is solid but it's almost as expensive as the ramen so I feel weird getting it. You can get a better old fashioned for 11 dollars at many other places. I'm not gonna complain about a 14 dollar bowl of dope ramen though.

Solid ramen place in Chicago and not far from the blue line. I went there around 545pm on a Saturday and there was about a 30 minute wait. The interior was very modern looking and bigger than I expected. I thought the service was pretty good, and there was an extensive amount of choices on the menu. 

If you're not feeling ramen, there were a lot of sushi options as well as japanese tapas and skewers. My bf and I split the fried chicken lollipops as an app and I got the tonkatsu ramen while he opted for the miso ramen. The fried chicken lollipops were really good. Perfectly crispy and tender and the dipping sauce that came with it was bombbbb. The tonkatsu ramen was also great. The pork belly melted in my mouth and the broth was flavorful and creamy without being overpowering. I get bloated pretty often when eating ramen, usually because there's too much stuff going on in the broth. But this broth was delicious without giving me any bloating afterwards. 

I did try a few bites of the miso ramen, but I definitely preferred the tonkatsu more. It had an interesting taste but I personally wasn't a huge fan. 

Overall, great place if you're craving japanese food!

Ever been to a restaurant where everything was amazingly perfect? No right? Because nothing is ever perfect. That would be completely ridiculous. Aaaaand then I found Wasabi. I'm a huge ramen fan, both in regards to being larger than most ramen fans, and that I have a huge man-crush on the embodiment of ramen.

Most ramen restaurants you go to will do ramen very well. But Wasabi did ramen, pork buns,sushi, and dessert well. Yes, I ate all that, which I guess kinda explained the huge comment.

My friend and I recently stopped by after spending the evening doing relatively healthy activities.  We walked right in, which as I understand it is not the norm of weekday evenings, so be prepared to wait a bit.  We both ordered ramen, because that's why we went.

In my opinion there are two kinds of ramen. You have ramen-fusion and traditional ramen.  Wasabi is more in line with traditional style ramen and I happen to prefer this to ramen fusion.  

As a appetizer I got an order of pork buns that were amazing.  The pork was flavorful and the bun was neither hard nor sticky.  And just because I'm a little fat kid, I also ordered the sushi.  Now, I assumed the sushi (salmon nigiri for anyone curious to know) was going to just be okay.  Maybe skimp on the fish, maybe a little bland, but no.  This sushi was the quality of sushi found at a sushi bar.

Needless to say, I enjoyed (and finished) all the food that was brought to my table.  Every items was made with attention and to order.  I would have thought that the ramen would have stood out above all other servings, but it didn't, and not because the ramen wasn't good, but because all the food was simply amazing.  Will I go back you ask?  That's as silly a question as asking, "are there grammatical errors in this review?"  The answer to both... hell yes!

Prepare for an exquisite dining experience and then later for your body to be wracked with thirst

The umami flavor bomb (MSG, what a lovely compound) was probably responsible for me drinking the Niagara Falls later that evening. (I think I drank a gallon of water?) But I suggest you leave the consequences for later, which is the way I mostly approach life. 

Get the spicy miso garlic roasted ramen. Get it. If I could choose a patronus it would be this. While it didn't spank my tastebuds as much as I thought it would, it transformed me into a ravenous creature. I give it a 4.5/5

I've definitely been here before, and I got something else. I want to say tonkotsu? I believe that the excessive creaminess of the broth was rough on the stomach, and it felt like I was drinking saltwater. But I don't really recall it's full experience, so I'm going say it's a fuzzy 3/5. 

Definitely come here and enjoy the rustic atmosphere and some spicy miso ramen.

First time I came to wasabi. I have been trying to come here for the past several months but always forget they aren't open all day. So never got the chance to stop in because I wasn't willing to wait for the place to open at 5 or wait too long for a table. Honestly I really wish I had come here sooner because they recently split the menus and you can only get sushi at the original location which is located next door. 

With that being said I visited the newer location which only serves ramen and small apps. My boyfriend and I were in the neighborhood and we decided to wait until they opened for once. We waited about an hour right before they opened. You would be surprised that people were already lining up and waiting in their cars for this place to open. Anyhow, within 25 minutes of being open the place was packed. The service was a little slow as far as being acknowledged by the servers go. We waited about 10 minutes before anyone approached us. Finally our server came by asked if we had any questions about the menu and we proceeded to order.  they have a drink menu but don't have many non alcoholic beverages which was ok but disappointing, if you're dining with people who don't drink. Also I believe it's byob next door. 

I had seen some chicken lollipops on another yelp review which we really wanted to try but they weren't on the menu. We ordered the spring rolls. I want to say they were chicken. This was my favorite thing I ate. The wrappers were golden brown and crispy, the filling was spicy but not overpowering, and the white sauce and fresh radish and micro greens gave it a refreshing and palate cleansing finish. Yummiest spring rolls I have ever tasted! 

I got the tonkotsu ramen and my bf got the spicy roasted garlic miso ramen. Both are traditionally dressed with Pork and egg. I've had traditional Japanese ramen a few times before and I can say I loved the consistency of wasabi's broth the best. The broth is slightly thicker than most and extremely flavorful. I asked for hot chili oil on the side to add to my ramen as to control the heat. It was perfect. I like spicy but not over powering to the point that I can no longer eat it. My bf loves spicy food so the spicy garlic was great for him.  

For desert we asked for mango and chocolate chip mochi. The server who wasn't our original server messed up and brought us green tea and mango instead. Our original server came back apologized and we got to keep the messed up order on top of the correct order. I think that was very considerate of him, seeing as though I wasn't mad either way. Lol mochi was good. I really enjoyed he chocolate chip and mango. The green tea was ok. 

Overall the food was great! The service kind of sucked at the beginning because we didn't have anyone serve us right away and everyone that had gotten there after us was already eating before we got our app. Probably lack of communication from front of house to servers. They need to be a little more organized. To be fair our server was nice and did provide good service. I'll be back but will probably go to the sushi side to try some of their menu items. 

Oh almost forgot they play funky upbeat lounge music. Honestly I don't know what genre it was but I love music, and can zone things out if I need to. I liked it but my bf thought it was loud and annoying!

I'm honestly OBSESSED with Wasabi's Ramen. Or been three times and ordered something different every time - always blown away. Whether you're looking for some spice to clear out your sinuses or playful flavors to dance on your palette, there are options for all. The vibe reminds me of a James Bond movie and the servers are all beautifully interesting?? Kind of a dream on a rainy day with a giant bowl of slurpy ramen in front of you. Their poke is also super good!

Came for the ramen, stayed for the ramen, but a 1 hour and 45 min wait time in between!! We were lucky enough to be able to have a seat while we waited, but definitely by the cusp of the hour mark we were starving and angry staring at people who had signed their checks but decided to stay at the table for an extra hour or so. With lines this long, waiters NEED to be more aggressive about nudging tables done with their meals and checks out the door. It is simply insensible and a lot of the reason why they have the wait that they do. Additionally, PLEASE merge the two restaurants, it really would make the most sense in terms of seating and the facility of coming here with varied palette groups.

I'm somewhat of a Ramen snob, so I had to go check it out and see if it was foreal ramen or not. I live in Dallas and so their ramen is getting there, but it still doesn't beat the east and west coast. I was pretty astonished by the reviews and pictures, so I had some high expectations upon arrival. There's really not many other businesses around, so I don't know who found out this place...but thank you !!

I saw some people waiting outside, so I thought great...it's going to be a long line and I'll be starving. That's what I get for coming around 7:30 on a Sunday night. But to my surprise...for 2 people, we got seated right away. It was pretty packed though and it was sure noisy,  but we were seated near the window on the far front side of the restaurant..so it's like we had our own little cozy corner. 

My husband and I started off with some sweet shrimp with the crispy fried shrimp head which melted in my mouth. We also had a bowl of Tako Wasa (wasabi infused wasabi)...which I've only ever had in 2 other restaurants. I wasn't mad at it at all. What a great start to the evening. 

I ordered the Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso Ramen. My husband had the Tonkatsu Ramen. 
I usually don't like too spicy of a food..and mine was kinda spicy. But after eating it for a bit longer...it really didn't taste that spicy. It's as if my palette got adjusted to it and I didn't feel it anymore, which I've never experienced before. But right away...from the broth, it was authentic for sure. The Tonkatsu was amazing as well. It's all about the broth man....
Everything else was on point too, from the soft boiled egg to the chaisu (it was exploding with flavor and the fattiness just added to its yummy goodness). I wanted to drink the soup base, but I was so full. 

Definitely will come back when I'm back for vacay....I'm just drooling now just thinking about it.

We are hosted by super cute and interesting Tyler. His energy is unbelivable and he is all smile. Food?! If I could give a 1000000000  I will. If I should choose only one place to go out it would be Wasabi. Modern design, industrial style, urban music but not too loud soooooo you can have fun with your friends or meet a new one. Wasabi is must for ramen lovers and ones who likes to discover.

This is my absolute favorite ramen place in Chicago.. 

That being said, there's a bad apple in the bunch as of late. I've always been welcomed with smiles and cheer here, but my last visit was met with lackluster service and being flat out ignored by a server named Bryan. I was the only person of color in the entire restaurant and was "greeted" with suspicious looks and , "can I help you? Oh, table for one?" Yes, Bryan, African Americans actually enjoy Japanese cuisine from time to time too. I'm not lost, I'm here to eat, not beg or rob the place.

He never checked on me. He asked if I was doing well as he briskly walked past my table to then graciously greet and serve the white guests who were also eating there.

After I paid, I left with no "thank you" or "goodbye".
I'm a regular at wasabi, but after my experience today I will not eat here again until the racist and classist staff are eliminated from the restaurant. Wasabi is a step above here in our neighborhood and the staff should be as well. 

When this is addressed and he is reprimanded will change my review to 5 stars and resume eating at your business.

We tried the sushi side and had an all around great experience. 

We've been meaning to try Wasabi for the past year, but were turned off by what seemed to be a long wait. It appears they've recently split the restaurants and have sushi/small plates/entrees/BYOB on one side and ramen / full bar on the other. 

We didn't have a wait on the sushi side and everything was delicious. We ordered beef skewers, house dumplings,  Logan roll, California roll, and shrimp tempura roll. The service was excellent and the price was reasonable: $42 including tax. 

We definitely plan to return and also try the ramen.

Wasabi is my go to spot for Ramen! Hands down one of the best spots in town. They recently moved next door and their old location became there sushi bar which I have yet to try. Their New place is still small but now they have a bar with some really great cocktails. They focus on Ramen appetizers and rice bowls. I Ordered the spicy roasted garlic miso which is one of there best dishes it has a spicy kick to it but it's not to bad i love how the pork just dissolves in your mouth and the soup is full of flavor. If you ever want the best Ramen in town wasabi is the place.

I'm honestly OBSESSED with Wasabi's Ramen. Or been three times and ordered something different every time - always blown away. Whether you're looking for some spice to clear out your sinuses or playful flavors to dance on your palette, there are options for all. The vibe reminds me of a James Bond movie and the servers are all beautifully interesting?? Kind of a dream on a rainy day with a giant bowl of slurpy ramen in front of you. Their poke is also super good!

Came for the ramen, stayed for the ramen, but a 1 hour and 45 min wait time in between!! We were lucky enough to be able to have a seat while we waited, but definitely by the cusp of the hour mark we were starving and angry staring at people who had signed their checks but decided to stay at the table for an extra hour or so. With lines this long, waiters NEED to be more aggressive about nudging tables done with their meals and checks out the door. It is simply insensible and a lot of the reason why they have the wait that they do. Additionally, PLEASE merge the two restaurants, it really would make the most sense in terms of seating and the facility of coming here with varied palette groups.

I'm somewhat of a Ramen snob, so I had to go check it out and see if it was foreal ramen or not. I live in Dallas and so their ramen is getting there, but it still doesn't beat the east and west coast. I was pretty astonished by the reviews and pictures, so I had some high expectations upon arrival. There's really not many other businesses around, so I don't know who found out this place...but thank you !!

I saw some people waiting outside, so I thought great...it's going to be a long line and I'll be starving. That's what I get for coming around 7:30 on a Sunday night. But to my surprise...for 2 people, we got seated right away. It was pretty packed though and it was sure noisy,  but we were seated near the window on the far front side of the restaurant..so it's like we had our own little cozy corner. 

My husband and I started off with some sweet shrimp with the crispy fried shrimp head which melted in my mouth. We also had a bowl of Tako Wasa (wasabi infused wasabi)...which I've only ever had in 2 other restaurants. I wasn't mad at it at all. What a great start to the evening. 

I ordered the Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso Ramen. My husband had the Tonkatsu Ramen. 
I usually don't like too spicy of a food..and mine was kinda spicy. But after eating it for a bit longer...it really didn't taste that spicy. It's as if my palette got adjusted to it and I didn't feel it anymore, which I've never experienced before. But right away...from the broth, it was authentic for sure. The Tonkatsu was amazing as well. It's all about the broth man....
Everything else was on point too, from the soft boiled egg to the chaisu (it was exploding with flavor and the fattiness just added to its yummy goodness). I wanted to drink the soup base, but I was so full. 

Definitely will come back when I'm back for vacay....I'm just drooling now just thinking about it.

So far, this takes the cake for the best ramen I've had in Chicago (a few more important ones to try though!). I think this was just overall a great bowl of ramen and when I asked for more bite on my noodles, that's exactly what I got. No complaints, it's worth the wait.

It's really hard to break habits.

Me: "Let's try a new ramen place."
Her: "Alright! Well there's this one we've been meaning to go to up north for a couple years now..."
Me: "Yea, friggin Wasabi always ropes us in."
Her: "Wasabi does sound good though..."

...annnnd that's how we always end up at Wasabi. 

Seriously even when I don't want ramen but want Japanese. Wasabi it is. The sushi and pork belly buns are so good. It's simple and delish

They recently expanded and I believe they are still BYOB (but don't quote me on that).

I had not been to Wasabi for a few months but a couple of months ago they changed their layout! Their old restaurant has exclusively become their sushi bar (which is BYOB) and right next door is their ramen bar, which is NOT BYOB. I thought it was an interesting move on their part. The new ramen bar is small as well with very cozy seating. Very nice date spot in my opinion!

With that being said, I love Wasabi's ramen! It's always my go-to spot when I'm in town. I always get the spicy garlic miso which appears to be a restaurant favorite. The soup base is incredibly flavorful with a spicy kick to it. The pork is also very tender and melts right in your mouth. 

I don't think I can ever get enough of Wasabi ramen!

If I could give this place 10 stars I would! Definitely the better (if not best) ramen spot I've tried. We ordered the sushi as appetizer and although the ramen was delicious I would say I actually enjoyed their sushi slightly more! You could really taste how fresh the ingredients were. 

The ramen of course was the main pull for our visit and it was so flavorful! I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen and my boyfriend ordered the Shoyu ramen. Both of which were very good choices but I did prefer my order more - haha! 

We went to Chicago for one weekend and this was definitely a spot we're glad we didn't miss out on.

Really good ramen! This might replace Ramen-San as my favorite in the city. I got the original Tonkotsu and the pork basically melted in my mouth. The broth was really flavorful as well. Somehow they made half an egg taste ridiculously delicious which is a feat in itself. My friend got the spicy garlic which I found to have the perfect level of spice-just a tiny kick but nothing crazy. The place was packed with a 30 minute wait on a Wednesday at 7:00 so get there early or prepare to wait!

This is a great place if you are looking for some lovely selection of Small eats (Tapas Style), booze and small eats. Great bar as well. Love the ambience and the food tasted very good. The service was top quality and is expected for the buck they charged. A premium dinner place but worth the hit on the wallet. There is a sushi place next door which is a BYOB but unfortunately doesnt have a bar. Not sure why they cant run both of them under the same liquor licence when they are named the same and next door to each other.

Great experience, a little too pricey for a $$ place on yelp. Great food, Great booze, Good Ambiance and Great Service.

I do love some good ramen.  I recently experienced the best ramen of my life over the summer but being in Chicago I reeled in my expectations and wasabi definitely fits the bill.

We came here on Christmas eve and there wasn't a line for 3.  I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and the broth was flavorful and the noodles were firm like I was hoping for. I was pretty hungry so the regular portion was satisfying but I wish I ordered extra noodles. A must next time for those that are extra hungry.

Overall a pleasant experience at a reasonable price for Chicago standards

The flash fried brussel sprouts appetizer was almost burnt, but good flavor. Very salty and vinegary though. Vegan ramen w/ buckwheat noodles was great. I personally thought the imitation meat was not necessary and kind of grossed me out. It even had the fake coagulated fat of beef on it. Blech. The broth was light and does not leave feeling as if you drank a cup of salt. Non-vegans in my party preferred this over the garlic miso ramen!

First off, Ramen is one of my favorite food groups (ha -there are so many different type of ramen...instant and non!).  But to be fair, I wanted to give the pro/cons of the whole Wasabi dining experience.

Pro:
-Ramen is delicious. Wasabi's broth is fabulous and they cook the noodles just right!  The egg is on point too! YUM!
-It's BYOB.

A con that can be a pro:
-There is always a line. So, expect to wait. So, if you are hangry, you need to go there knowing that fact or your date/friend(s) may not want to wait with you. The pro of that is that it shows that it's tasty and done many people good!

Also, try their kimchi fried roll - I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious they were! 

Enjoy your ramen experience! :D

A very Japanese source tipped me off to this place as one of two most authentic ramen restaurants in Chicago, and after having it on my list for the longest time, finally made my way over there last weekend. Was happy to say it did not disappoint, and in regards to traditional ramen broth, it is probably my favorite in Chicago as far as flavor balance. I tried out the Hakata red and the tokyu classic shoyu. While all their ramens aside from the vegan tan tan men have a pork bone based broth, the hakata is a less creamy variation compared to the original tonkotsu, while the classic shoyu substitutes much of the pork bone with chicken broth, offering a cleaner, less oily flavor. Both were delicious. The detail to the add-ons was likewise expertly done, with perfectly soft-boiled eggs and pork(both the belly and char siu) that was tender in both the lean and fatty portions, which melted on tongue and percolated throughout it for minutes afterwards.  The portions seemed on the smaller side when they first arrive, but that's more from the shape of the bowl; both me and my gf were full and satisfied by the end of the meal. It starts a tad higher than some ramen in the city at $14 bowl, but despite that we felt as if the quality was justifiable, and were glad to finally make our way here.

Best spicy ramen I have ever had! Broth was full of flavor and actually spicy (which you don't always get at other places), pork did not smell at all, and the bamboo shoots had excellent flavor and texture. 

The presentation on the rolls were amazing. I purposely ordered the hot yogi vegan roll because I wanted to taste the full flavor of their famous fresh wasabi and it is very good. 

I also like the variety of their menu, especially because they had oyster and uni shooters! 

Also ordered tonkotsu ramen (delicous), takoyaki (very good), and surf and turf (average).

Price is pretty reasonable. I heard there normally is a long wait especially because they don't take reservations. I went on a Wednesday evening around 7pm and we got seated right away.

If you are hungry, never ever come to this place unless you want to spend 100 dollar to fill your stomach. We ordered two ramen and one carpaccio. After tip $50. BUT we felt having nothing. The smallest ramen I ever had. Just to mention, I had tried many famous ramen restaurants. And this place doesnt have Japanese chef. So it's not authentic at all. I don't understand why this place has such a high rating! It's cheating. 

Don't come here for food, for drinks maybe OK. This place should be assigned to bar category not restaurant!

We were excited to try the new space one door down from the original location, which we have loved for years. It was disappointing. 

Good:
- Ramen is the same as in the original location.

Bummer:
- no sushi at this location. Now it is sushi next door or ramen here.

Bad:
- Service was not good. The hostess just stared at us when we walked, no greeting. The server stopped by our table exactly 3 times. once to take our order, once when we were almost finished, and the last time with the check. And she wasn't that nice. 
- I had a glass of sake, and it tasted way off, like plastic. I would have told our server and ordered something else but she didn't stop by again until we were almost ready to leave. My husband drank it, I have no idea why, he said he didn't like it either.
- Ahi poke bowl - the rice was crunchy in the middle. Again, I would have told our server but she didn't stop by. If the rice were ok I wouldn't consider it bad, but the poke was just OK. It wasn't good.

This was one of my favorite food experiences in Chicago. Wasabi definitely lived up to its hype. I love izakaya feel restaurants and I'm so glad I got to try this one! We stopped by the CVS bc other reviews mentioned it and got a 6 pack to go along with our meal... we arrived maybe 15-20 minutes after opening and got seated quickly. It was pretty empty when we got there but by the time we left the place was PACKED, and there was a steady line forming. But guys... really. Really worth the line. There's like an awning by the door and here was a space heater in it for the guests in line. 

We ordered a lot and shared it all. We ordered based on Yelp recommendations, and they were sooo good. Next time I think I'll try more "new" things off the menu. 

-spicy garlic ramen was fantastic because the noodles are perfectly al dente. The texture made each bite worth it for me.

-LOVED the le Japon and Artmex rolls. Flavorful and unique. We also got a spicy scallop roll, which was good for being a basic roll.

-pork belly buns... I don't really eat pork because it has a strong taste sometimes, but these were really good.

-takoyaki

-lollipop chicken 

... side note: the couple sitting next to us got seated maybe 15 minutes after us when the place started filling up and I noticed their order took FOREEEEVER to come out. I guess the kitchen gets backed up. I feel like if this had happened to us, it would've been hard to give the place 5 stars because the experience really makes/breaks a restaurant. I think the best advice would be to come early, or be prepared to have food come out late.

We had went to Wasabi on a Thursday night at 10:30pm. 2 of us were seated at the communal table. Another 3 came in and sat next to us as well as another couple which were seated behind us at another table. They were moderately busy.  We waited 10 minutes until a server came to take our order. Simple, 2 ramens and 2 apps. The people coming in after us had already placed their orders and began receiving their food by this time. We continue to patiently wait. 

At 10:55 the server comes to us and says she will check on the food. She comes back 2 minutes later and says the kitchen lost the ticket and they already started putting the food away and cleaning up. The server ends by telling us sorry theres nothing she can do. The sad part is she didnt offer any compensation or contact information in case they wanted to make it up.

We got up and furiously left and went to Furious Spoon instead where they dont lose your tickets and close the kitchen on you after they take your order and make you wait for half an hour. This restaurant deserves 0 stars if there was this option.

It's so sad I cannot rate 0 star.

I have been to wasabi for 6 years and it's also the place I first dated with my wife since I moved to Chicago. And it's always a nice place to enjoy the ramen and some sushi rolls at the same time. However, now you cannot have ramen and sushi at the same time. And the waiter told me you cannot even bring the wasabi sushi to wasabi ramen even you get the pickup next door.  Oh, what a great business and great idea. I won't come back since they literally ruined my marriage party.

Enjoy your ramen experience! :D

Great ramen! My whole family went on a Wednesday night with no reservation and it was already almost full. If we went on a weekend I'm sure it'd be very crowded. The ramen was amazing, however my father complained of his being gritty? Other than that there were no complaints!

A very Japanese source tipped me off to this place as one of two most authentic ramen restaurants in Chicago, and after having it on my list for the longest time, finally made my way over there last weekend. Was happy to say it did not disappoint, and in regards to traditional ramen broth, it is probably my favorite in Chicago as far as flavor balance. I tried out the Hakata red and the tokyu classic shoyu. While all their ramens aside from the vegan tan tan men have a pork bone based broth, the hakata is a less creamy variation compared to the original tonkotsu, while the classic shoyu substitutes much of the pork bone with chicken broth, offering a cleaner, less oily flavor. Both were delicious. The detail to the add-ons was likewise expertly done, with perfectly soft-boiled eggs and pork(both the belly and char siu) that was tender in both the lean and fatty portions, which melted on tongue and percolated throughout it for minutes afterwards.  The portions seemed on the smaller side when they first arrive, but that's more from the shape of the bowl; both me and my gf were full and satisfied by the end of the meal. It starts a tad higher than some ramen in the city at $14 bowl, but despite that we felt as if the quality was justifiable, and were glad to finally make our way here.

Best spicy ramen I have ever had! Broth was full of flavor and actually spicy (which you don't always get at other places), pork did not smell at all, and the bamboo shoots had excellent flavor and texture. 

The presentation on the rolls were amazing. I purposely ordered the hot yogi vegan roll because I wanted to taste the full flavor of their famous fresh wasabi and it is very good. 

I also like the variety of their menu, especially because they had oyster and uni shooters! 

Also ordered tonkotsu ramen (delicous), takoyaki (very good), and surf and turf (average).

Price is pretty reasonable. I heard there normally is a long wait especially because they don't take reservations. I went on a Wednesday evening around 7pm and we got seated right away.

If you are hungry, never ever come to this place unless you want to spend 100 dollar to fill your stomach. We ordered two ramen and one carpaccio. After tip $50. BUT we felt having nothing. The smallest ramen I ever had. Just to mention, I had tried many famous ramen restaurants. And this place doesnt have Japanese chef. So it's not authentic at all. I don't understand why this place has such a high rating! It's cheating. 

Don't come here for food, for drinks maybe OK. This place should be assigned to bar category not restaurant!

We were excited to try the new space one door down from the original location, which we have loved for years. It was disappointing. 

Good:
- Ramen is the same as in the original location.

Bummer:
- no sushi at this location. Now it is sushi next door or ramen here.

Bad:
- Service was not good. The hostess just stared at us when we walked, no greeting. The server stopped by our table exactly 3 times. once to take our order, once when we were almost finished, and the last time with the check. And she wasn't that nice. 
- I had a glass of sake, and it tasted way off, like plastic. I would have told our server and ordered something else but she didn't stop by again until we were almost ready to leave. My husband drank it, I have no idea why, he said he didn't like it either.
- Ahi poke bowl - the rice was crunchy in the middle. Again, I would have told our server but she didn't stop by. If the rice were ok I wouldn't consider it bad, but the poke was just OK. It wasn't good.

This was one of my favorite food experiences in Chicago. Wasabi definitely lived up to its hype. I love izakaya feel restaurants and I'm so glad I got to try this one! We stopped by the CVS bc other reviews mentioned it and got a 6 pack to go along with our meal... we arrived maybe 15-20 minutes after opening and got seated quickly. It was pretty empty when we got there but by the time we left the place was PACKED, and there was a steady line forming. But guys... really. Really worth the line. There's like an awning by the door and here was a space heater in it for the guests in line. 

We ordered a lot and shared it all. We ordered based on Yelp recommendations, and they were sooo good. Next time I think I'll try more "new" things off the menu. 

-spicy garlic ramen was fantastic because the noodles are perfectly al dente. The texture made each bite worth it for me.

-LOVED the le Japon and Artmex rolls. Flavorful and unique. We also got a spicy scallop roll, which was good for being a basic roll.

-pork belly buns... I don't really eat pork because it has a strong taste sometimes, but these were really good.

-takoyaki

-lollipop chicken 

... side note: the couple sitting next to us got seated maybe 15 minutes after us when the place started filling up and I noticed their order took FOREEEEVER to come out. I guess the kitchen gets backed up. I feel like if this had happened to us, it would've been hard to give the place 5 stars because the experience really makes/breaks a restaurant. I think the best advice would be to come early, or be prepared to have food come out late.

We had went to Wasabi on a Thursday night at 10:30pm. 2 of us were seated at the communal table. Another 3 came in and sat next to us as well as another couple which were seated behind us at another table. They were moderately busy.  We waited 10 minutes until a server came to take our order. Simple, 2 ramens and 2 apps. The people coming in after us had already placed their orders and began receiving their food by this time. We continue to patiently wait. 

At 10:55 the server comes to us and says she will check on the food. She comes back 2 minutes later and says the kitchen lost the ticket and they already started putting the food away and cleaning up. The server ends by telling us sorry theres nothing she can do. The sad part is she didnt offer any compensation or contact information in case they wanted to make it up.

We got up and furiously left and went to Furious Spoon instead where they dont lose your tickets and close the kitchen on you after they take your order and make you wait for half an hour. This restaurant deserves 0 stars if there was this option.

It's so sad I cannot rate 0 star.

I have been to wasabi for 6 years and it's also the place I first dated with my wife since I moved to Chicago. And it's always a nice place to enjoy the ramen and some sushi rolls at the same time. However, now you cannot have ramen and sushi at the same time. And the waiter told me you cannot even bring the wasabi sushi to wasabi ramen even you get the pickup next door.  Oh, what a great business and great idea. I won't come back since they literally ruined my marriage party.

(This review is coming from me visiting Japan and eating authentic yakitori and sashimi). The sashimi is not impressive at all. The fish was very odd tasting, almost like it had a funny after taste. The Uni was so bad, although it was the Santa Barbara US Uni, I still did not end up finishing it. The yakitori skewers were not life changing. The chicken gizzards were tough and crunchy and did not taste very good either. The beef rib eye was just okay, still tough and not as tender as I had hoped for. The ONLY thing that I liked was the oyster shooter. And the waitress was very sweet.

Best ramen in Chicago, hands down. It's BYOB, but if you forget to bring a bottle you can buy across the street.  The sushi is good too, but we go for the Ramen. Parking can be hard depending on the time of day and whether there's something going on in the area.

Best ramen I've found in chicago so far. I used to live in San Francisco where there were many awesome ramen places. This one comes closest in terms of taste.  Also they have several great appetizers. My favorite is the chicken lollipops.

Lines can be a little crazy, and prices are a bit high.  Get there right when it opens if you don't want to wait.

This is William Lee, Whitney M's boyfriend and older brother of Justin Lee. We have been wasabi loyalists for over 4 years and come a few times every month usually on Saturday and Sunday's for brunch. Standard order is : pork belly buns, super white tuna avo roll and either spicy garlic miso or tonkotsu (with chili oil and the upgraded pork belly) 

I am currently writing this review after finishing my bowl of Tonkatsu ramen and finding out that Wasabi will stop serving ramen after this weekend. Wasabi will only be serving sushi and yakitori? The new place next door will serve ramen but doesn't open till 6pm?

How will we have Wasabi for brunch?? I can't stand waiting in lines and refuse to wait hours with those young kids. How will I order my usual order??? I am absolutely DEVASTATED as you can tell that I'm extremely passionate and loyal to WASABI. It feels like my long time girlfriend is cheating on me.

Food: 5 stars
Service: -4 stars
Total: 1 star

Since they have split their ramen and sushi business into two separate entities, they must have spread their staff thin. Don't trust the service until they have a fully trained staff that knows their menu. 

A member in my party asked for Katsu Don with no egg. Of course, it comes with egg. Once we sent it back, the server comes back and says that they can't make it without egg. Fair enough, however our unfortunate friend had to watch the rest of the party eat their noodles before they got too cold and bloated for consumption. 

If you have ANY dietary restrictions, be sure to explicitly, and loudly state it. Ask questions and make sure you get confirmation from your server that it can be done- as their staff seems ignorant of their own menu.

So it saddens me to give one star to my favorite ramen place, but they clearly do not focus on customer service whatsoever. That reallllllllly grinds my gears, especially when I'm not even asking for anything irrational. 

Came in today to enjoy lunch with my family (5 ppl). They had split up the restaurant to two places next door from each other. One place has ramen and small plates, while the original spot has sushi. That's a mistake splitting the menu. The ramen place has a wait while the original spot (sushi) only had a few people when I went in. In my opinion, they should have just invested more into construction and made it one large restaurant. 

Regardless! I came in and waited for about half an hour since there are only 2 tables that can fit larger groups (5 or more). There's also one large community table they have at the center of the restaurant where we're currently sitting as I write this review. We had just ordered the food and one of the larger tables opened up. I asked the host if we could switch spots since I have to yell across the table to say something to my brother. I guess that's a big deal????? He said it's not possible because we already had ordered the food and it messes up their system if they move us.....are you kidding me?? Seriously? You can't move us because we already placed an order...? I didn't even mention that they told us 15 min but we already had waited double the amount of time which is why we wanted to get seated sooner. That I underhand is not always in their control so whatever. 

Now as for the food. We've been waiting for about another 20 min. My dads meal came out before ours and he's already done eating while are still waiting for our food. This is seriously a joke. The garlic wasabi ramen is my favorite ramen in the city but they're really messing up right now. Plus, they got rid of the spicy chicken wings....they must on be crack or something cause those were phenomenal.  End rant. I'm just going to do my best to enjoy my meal and get out of here....if it ever comes out

Disappointed with the changes. I've been eating at the original Wasabi since they opened.  The food and dining experience was nothing but stellar. BUT...

The new split restaurant dining space has changed the vibe and overall quality. No longer is it BYOB. Which I can look past because the bartenders were able to mix off the menu drinks for our table. The selection is good but a tad overpriced. (1 Star)

They still host the same appetizer selection and I can safely still recommend the pork belly buns and the Brussels sprouts (1 star).  

Okay, so your asking yourself, so the drinks were good and so were the appetizers; why give it two stars?

Glad you asked! The focus of any ramen restaurant is...THE RAMEN. And let me tell you, I couldn't even get past bite three (and I normally finish my bowl in less than 10 minutes).  Heartbreak sets in as my go to ramen dish in all of Chicago was ruined...noodles were undercooked (think two minutes before al dente) the pork was over cooked (needed a knife to cut through it) and the broth was under seasoned (0 stars). For an hour and 15 minute wait and a hint of pretentiousness in the air; I'll take my business elsewhere.

I hope to find a replacement restaurant soon as a truly good ramen experience in Chicago is hard to come by and Wasabi has officially lost the title of Best Ramen in The Midwest.  

Right now you are better off at Ramen San or taking a walk down the street to their neighborhood rival Furious Spoon as both those places are still serving a consistent and decent bowl of Ramen.

One word: phenomenal.

I was visiting from San Francisco, which has one of the best food scenes in the world, and I love fine dining of all sorts. But even despite that, this restaurant completely blew me away.

The first thing I want to applaud was the excellent service. Our waiter, Devin, was top-class. Not only did he give the BEST recommendations (we literally ordered everything he suggested), but he was such a personable and fun person who made the dining experience that much more enjoyable. I came here with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary, so we really appreciated the great service for our special occasion.

Our favorite dishes:
- Raibu Kani
- Washugyu
- Momomaki roll
- Chef's nigiri selection

Other dishes we ordered:
- Beef don buri
- Mentaiko spaghetti

The don buri was done quite well. It's just that you're not really going to be blown away by don buri, based off the nature of the dish. The spaghetti was super interesting to try since I've never heard of that dish before, but not quite as mouthwatering as the first 4 dishes I mentioned.

All in all, almost all the food dishes left me craving for more, and even as I write this review 2 days later, I'm itching to go back! (Hopefully one day, if I'm ever back in Chicago.) 

One of the top 5 most enjoyable dinners of my life. Thank you!!

We've always raved about how amazing this place is and how it was our favorite sushi spot in Chicago but we were a bit underwhelmed this last visit. Came here for my fianc's birthday, had a reservation at 7:30 but wasn't seated until about 8. I get it was a Friday night but what's the point of making a reservation? There also was some confusion and the hostess took us to the wrong table and left us in the middle of the restaurant without saying anything.

We were then sandwiched between to other tables so it was quite a tight fit. There wasn't really enough space for food we ordered when it came out. We decided to just stick with sushi this time and got a few rolls and the chef's seasonal nigiri. They were good but not as memorable as our previous visit. Bummer :/

Still a nice place for a date night but probably no longer gonna be our go to for sushi.

Ate at the Izakaya last Weds. They have an awesome happy hour (6-8) that's 3 courses with a cocktail for $25. I think it's the best deal in the city for the quality, but don't tell anyone. 

Had amazing uni and quail egg shooters. One of the best bites of food I've had in a long time. We also split a bunch of the dishes, like the uni pasta (we like uni) and the beef with gravy. Everything is good, so try whatever you like. 

Cocktails are also pretty good. They're full priced, but fair. Have some interesting Japanese-focused flavors in them as well. 

Will definitely come back for the happy hour.

My husband brought me to Momotaro for our one year wedding anniversary. I had no idea what to expect except that it was a higher end sushi restaurant. For your information it is also a sake bar, which is located downstairs from the restaurant, and they have hot/cold menu options.

The menu itself is a little different in its presentation, but your server will help you through it like ours did. I'd also like to take a moment to praise our server Daniel. He was so amazing! A super attentive server is the difference between a good and great experience. Daniel was very patient with us, made sure we understood the menu, and also provided suggestions along the way. If you ever read this, thank you Daniel for making the night wonderful!

Onto the food! For starters we ordered the soft shell prawn skewers. While these were very delicious, I'd warn against them if you're a messier eater. You do have to de-shell them and they can make for messy hands. We also ordered meatball skewers. Much cleaner and equally good.  And now for the sushi. Their rolls are very different from what I normally order, but in this case different is good. A little of they in house soy sauce goes a long way, so don't overdo it or you'll take away from the taste profile. 

Finally the price. As I said it was a higher end sushi restaurant and sake bar, so definitely expect the prices for two with dinner and drinks to be north of $100. It's not an everyday haunt, but it makes for a memorable experience or a nice anniversary.

I've always wanted to checkout this place every since i discovered the magic of Fulton Market, and it did not disappoint.

I made a reservation for 4 at 8:30 PM on a Sunday through OpenTable and was quick and painless. We were quickly seated and introduced to the menu. 

Our server was extremely awesome and gave us a very thorough introduction of the menu. Everything was seasoned and cooked to perfection, presentations were also extremely on point. Each time a dish comes out, the chef comes out of the kitchen, brings his creation to the table, and presents it right in front of you- it cannot get anymore authentic and special than that. 

My favorite dishes were:
Dashi Aged tofu- perfect broth, perfect texture, the mushrooms were awesome.
Udon- cooked in beef fat, with tender and thinly sliced beef, juicy, flavorful, rich, delicious.
The momo special maki roll- spicy, fresh, full of flavors!

Between the 4 of us, we ordered 3 makis, 2 skewer dishes, 1 rice dish, 1 udon dish, and a tofu dish. Total turned out to be $140 for four which was a great deal, as we all left with happy full stomach :)

The highlight was definitely my complimentary birthday dessert, we got free pocky topped with confetti! So fun and definitely finished our meal with a sweet tone.

Overall, the service, ambiance, food were above my expectation, and well worth the money, especially if you go with a party of four and more to get more variety and share between more people!  DELICIOUS! WOULD COME BACK AGAIN!

The bartender was great (didn't catch her name) but she made great cocktails. MURAKAMI DAIQUIRI & MONK'S JOURNEY (matcha green tea) were delicious. The sake list was great as well. 

The food:
Balfego tuna ($20) - Good 
Shortrib meatballs ($12) - Good
Age dashi tofu ($14) - Decent (I would skip this dish next time)
Gyudon - imperial beef with rice ($18) - Exceptional
Alaskan king crab ($26) - Good but small portion (1 leg and a small leg) that was shared amongst 4 people. 
Kumamoto beef to hotate - garlic wagu beef ($12) - Exceptional
Sake sashimi ($4) - Good BUT it was frozen in the middle =\
Hamachi ($4) - Fresh and delicious 
Otoro ($10) - Good EXCEPT there were bones in 2 of the pieces =\
Go Takara - hamachi, spicy tuna, snapper, etc ($24) - Good

I highly recommend the Gyudon (we ordered 2 of them because it was THAT good) and we ordered more of the Kumamoto beef. Service was exceptional. I would definitely come back and that's saying a lot since there's a lot of restaurants I have on my list to try in downtown.

After an extensive food crawl around Chicago (including Alinea!, Avent, the purple pig, all the pizza joints, etc), this was by far my favorite meal in Chicago. The atmosphere was very classy yet casual, the service fast and friendly, and the food was amazing. 

Favorite must haves: 
Alaskan King crab-creative presentation and delicious
Chawanmushi-great texture and flavor
Chef's special nigiri-very fresh and light
Dessert: sesame kurondaiku. OMG this is the best dessert I have ever had. Gently flavorful, perfectly textured, and not too sweet or heavy. A year later, I still think about this dessert every so often. 

The curry udon and aburi buri were good but not my favorite. 

For the price, especially coming from Alinea the night before (!), this was quite a treat. Would definitely come back!

All together a great bar dining experience.  A couple of my friends brought me here while visiting Chicago.  I am a sushi lover!  We came by after dinner elsewhere, "just for drinks."  That never holds true...

I couldn't resist trying some things on the menu.  

First, it's a beautifully designed restaurant that caters to all dining needs.  The three level restaurant has an upstairs private room for large parties, ground level table and bar fine dining, and basement level casual dining bar with limited menu. 

We sat at the ground level bar.  The sake selections are numerous and the bartenders are genuinely happy to make your drinks to your liking. 

Needless to say, we had sake, cocktails and a few izakaya dishes.  Everything was delicious.  If I were local, I could see myself frequenting this place!

I would recommend for a fantastic quality sushi spot in Chicago.  

Got the Chef's Choice (omikase) and was a great choice.  Top notch quality of sushi served.  

Toro, ebi topped with uni, etc etc.  9 pce for $55.  A deal in my opinion if you enjoy quality sushi, presented in an original way.

Service was top notch as well, ambiance is classy.  Only gripe is our table was very close to the next table.  Other than that, I recommend whole-heartedly for sushi.

The space felt chique and modern for an izakaya (it is part of the BOKA group after all). Dimly lit and inviting ambiance. Host was nice. She mentioned there was a happy hour going on and we were seated right away. 

The menu was frustrating to choose from. The options and price didn't seem too enticing. The waiter did not offer much for suggestions and when we did ask he wasn't too detailed. My girl friend and I both got the happy hour special with the bartender special drink, fish entree which came with clam miso soup (decent), lettuce salad (okay) and sushi rice (good). It wasn't busy but generally, the service was slow and the food took some time to arrive. I didn't like the flavor of the fish. It was moist but it didn't seem very fresh or maybe it was the flavor profile. The highlight was the ice cream sandwiches (the one that was not matcha was good). 

The service was a bit abrupt as the waiter cleared plates even though my friend had her bowl of food in hand and was clearly eating still. And he even took away drinks before I was done. 

My friend was rather frustrated and I can't say I'll be rushing back anytime soon.

This was the best Japanese restaurant I've been to period. Evergthing from the food to service to ambiance was incredible. When you walk in expecting some rustic and old place you are surprised by the modern and authentic feel of the place. 

The best thing we ordered was probably the sirloin steak over charcoal. It was cooked to perfection an was probably the best steak I've ever had. The sushi as well was very fresh and simple, just the way good sushi should be. The dish that surprised us the most was the beef skewers which were drizzled in 2 amazing sauces. The beef melted in my mouth and the sauces were exceptional.

Overall, I would definitely come back to this restaurant as soon as I'm back in Chicago and would recommend it to anyone visiting.

Wow. Wow. Wow. Delicious food on the separate vegetarian menu. Great place for a business dinner (classy, clean, tasty, expensive) where everyone will leave happy!!

I had thought Shizen in San Francisco was the only lace in the US that could do vegetarian Japanese food well, but this place proved me wrong. I had a delicious, filling dinner with items from the vegetarian menu that felt more traditional than what I'd get from a vegan/creative sushi place in SF: 

Agedashi tofu (vegetarian) - there are two versions of this so get the one without Bonito flakes! Warm, delicious, soft tofu cooked in a Japanese style

Momotaro Tartare - simple but delicious dish primarily made out of bread and tomatoes 

Chef's vegetarian nigiri tasting - classic Japanese flavors without the fish/meat. Subtle but delightful flavors

Eggplant sushi - great combination of fried eggplant with other ingredients made this something that even the carnivores grabbed for

I chose to come here instead of check out the fireworks on Navy Pier and do not regret it at all! I had a wonderful time and can't wait to come back! Great job with having vegetarian options!!

The sushi here is the best I've had in the United States-- I asked our waiter and apparently the fish is flown in from Japan everyday... 
The non-sushi dishes were also delicious. Very good flavor and beautiful presentation.
Service is generally pretty good.
The only downside is that the restaurant is pretty pricey and the portions are small

Honest review: didnt like it nothing blew me away. The sushi is pretty plain nothing that u cant get somewhere else for being revered  as the best sushi at least do things different and atleast deliver that promise for being the best the service was okay nothing special didnt give good recommendations didnt describe all the food n took away utencils and didnt give new ones took away the hotsauce that they charged for when we still eating n the wasabi i paid for n like we were done eating and waited forever to order dessert
the only thing i thought was worth ordering again was the Hotate and the Brown butter piroquettes theres alot better places that are cheaper n tastier u dont need to spend a fortune for basic food my favorite sushi place is still kaizan 

Mentaiko Spaghetti 15$ didnt like it not as good as mott street. this needed texture really badly and needed something to make it more decadent and needed more of a pop was very bland

Aji yakusugi 12$ (Smoked fish) meh good but thought it was gonna be different the smoke just added smell didnt add any flavor to it 

Curry Udon 19$ (be warned its supper hot when it comes to the table give it a minute to cool down) good but curry was not home made which is disappointing since this restaurant is so expensive. theres pork in here with shisto peppers and theres like a cabbage salad on top. My favorite part is the shisto peppers cause it adds heat n mixed with the curry sauce makes it taste so good just no knife so hard to cut it the salad added some sweetness to it which was good i would order this again jus make the curry from scratch put more shisto peppers n more salad on it

Hotate $18 really tasty i love raw scallops there great texturally and have a great sweetness to them its a good dish but is very one dimensional all the components are sour so it goes well with the sweet scallops however this dish needs some heat to counter act that and something salty too n this dish needs texture badly 

Live dungeness rice $28 good but needed more uni. The risotto texture was perfect supper creamy without being mushy. The crab adds a wonderful sweet component and the veggies add freshness theres like one uni on top which adds saltyness and brinyness i added wasabi and hotsauce and soysauce to make it taste better so it was lacking complexity  

Ogo $6 (seaweed salad)
I was surprised but this was really good. The seaweed has a nice briny salty taste to it and the dressing is sweet and acidic to cut through the brinyness my only complaint add some heat and texture to it

Cedar roasted kurodai (seabream) $30 good but i had better fish in my life. The skin was crispy however the way it was put on the plate the skin on the other side got soggy. The fish itself didnt have a grilled flavor or was that flavorful was pretty bland and was overcooked i loved the sauce it tasted like mint was really refreshing just was expecting more since it was 30 bucks no complexity

Brown butter piroquettes 11$ best dessert of the nite. there kind of like cookies but not exactly i loved that there savory just wish there was more of them and they were small cause there supper crunchy so kinda hard to eat the white chocolate cream adds great sweetness and theres a bunch of acidic components to cut through the sweetness

Black currant mochi 10$ picture like a pb and j only thing its a kinda basic dessert n the mochi part was unappetizing cause texturally it was supper hard and leathery like fruit roll up

My favorite sushi place ever (even beats the fresh sushi out in Hawaii).  They have their fish flown in daily so it's still fresh (and makes for a pricey meal).

I love this place so much.  The food and drinks are all so creative and amazing. 

My favorite thing to order here is the otoro sashimi.  All the sashimi just literally melts in your mouth.  One time I was here and they had a special which was otoro tartar...so good.
I've tried some of the skewers- the hatsu (chicken heart), shortrib meatballs, and washugyu. The shortrib was my favorite of the skewers.
I've tried both the curry udon and the spaghetti.  The udon was a larger order than I imagined.  It came out piping hot.  Both noodle dishes were good.  I'd be ok ordering more nigiri and skipping the noodles in the future though.
On to the nigirizushi....I've had the aburi beni toro, Hokkaido hotate, and I think the aji yakusugi.  The first two stood out in my mind.  I remember wanting to order more. 
The momomaki is the only maki I've tried.  I prefer sticking with the sashimi or nigiri over the rolls here.

As for drinks...I've had the monk's journey only.  I want to try the other drinks but somehow I keep going back to the same drink. 

Service is always great.  The atmosphere is more romantic.  It's dimly lit inside.  I've always made my reservations on OpenTable about a week ahead of time and haven't had too much trouble getting the time slot I wanted.

We celebrated our 15 year wedding anniversary at Momotaro last night, and it didn't disappoint.  From start to finish, the meal was perfect.  Every morsel of food was delicious!  Anything with crab was scrumptious.  Loved the skirt steak skewer.  Our server, Christopher, was attentive but not annoying.  He advised us on how to order, which was key!  They added special touches like complimentary 1/2 glass of champagne to toast our anniversary, menus with "Happy Anniversary" printed on them, and a visit by the very friendly beverage director.  My husband and I love to try new restaurants on the weekends and many do not live up to the hype.  Momotaro is the exception!

I came here on a Monday night. I arrived in ORD at around 6:30 and called the restaurant right away for a 7:45 sushi bar reservation. I got there at 8:00pm and was seated right away at the sushi bar. 

The service was attentive and quick. The server seemed very knowledgeable with the menu items. I don't have any complaints for the service I received that night. 

Drinks: I ordered the Rapsberry Yuzu soda per my server's recommendation. The soda was good, but is it worth $5? I don't think so. 

I ordered Tsukune (grilled chicken meatballs), Mentaiko Spaghetti, Sushi - Aji Yakusugi (1000 year old smoked Shimaji), Aburi Beni Toro (salmon belly), Aburi Otoro (tuna belly), Baja Uni, Ikura, Botan Ebi, and Edomae Anago.

Tsukune - Best I've had in the United States so far. It was seasoned just right and grilled to perfection (very juicy on the inside). The only thing I would recommend changing is to pair it with raw egg yolk rather than sunny-side-up whole quail egg. The cooked quail egg just made eating the Tsukune a little awkward. 

Mentaiko Spaghetti - To die for! I would get this over and over again. When I was done with my dish, I had a little sauce left on the plate. I was really tempted to lick the plate or the spoon the sauce into my mouth. The Mentaiko gives the dish a very distinct saltiness and the sauce with the spaghetti was just that good. 

Aji Yakusugi - This dish is the reason I came to Momotaro after reading their menu and reviews online. When the server opened the lid, the aroma of the cypress send me to a smell heaven. However, the aroma of the 1000 year old cypress did not make an "imprint" on the smoked Shimaji nigiri at all. I do not know if the server should have smoked it a little longer or if the restaurant needs to figure out a way to get that aroma in the nigiri. Nonetheless, the fish was fresh and the rice was made right. I was just bummed that there is not a hint of the cypress aroma. 

Aburi Beni Toro and Aburi Otoro - both were lightly torched and both were very fresh. I would order them again. 

Baja Uni - originally, I wanted to order the Hokkaido Uni. However, they were out of Hokkaido Uni the day of my visit, so I switched to Baja Uni (purple uni). The taste of Baja uni is quite different than Hokkaido uni, the Baja uni is more on the salty, ocean-y side whereas the Hokkaido uni is more on the creamy side. I don't think Baja Uni is my thing, but everybody is different when it comes to uni preference. One thing I can say though, the uni was very fresh. 

Edomae Anago - I ended my meal with this nigiri. I always like to end my sushi meal either with a "dessert piece" aka "a piece of sweet nigiri" or Chawamushi. This time, I choice a dessert piece. The Edomae Anago was made right with just the right amount of sweetness. Personally, I prefer the ones where the Anago is already cooked sweet instead of the ones where the cooked the Anago then top it with sweet sauce. But again, that's just my personal preference. 

I would come back again.

I left Momotaro feeling sadly underwhelmed. Maybe my expectations were built up too high, but the food was lacking in the diverse array of flavors I was looking for. I tried 6 different plates and only really enjoyed 2 of them. 

Additionally, the initial service we received was atrocious. I was taken aback by how rude the hostess was. Luckily, we had a wonderful waiter & he was a significant redeeming factor.

Had an amazing dinner experience here last weekend. We started out with drinks downstairs when our table wasn't ready - natsujikan and present tense. Both really well presented and tasty. 

Once we sat upstairs we had our waiter give us a run down of the menu and he highly recommended the momotaro tartare. Trust him and me, get this! So different but so incredibly good. We also ordered: shishito peppers (amazing miso dipping sauce), shortrib meatball skewer (two thumbs up), washugyu skewer (melt in your mouth goodness) and a miso soup to start. Definite repeats: tartare and shortrib meatball. For round two we got: otoro nigiri, Baja uni (they were out of hokkaido uni), aji yakosugi and the momomaki. The fish was so fresh and went down smooth like butter. I could have eaten so many more pieces! 

Overall simple but gorgeous spot with tasty drinks and great quality food. Perfect for a special occasion.

I simply love this place as its just a gorgeous spot with good stuff inside!

I came here as a group that I am apart of decided to have an event here and I was pretty excited about it since I have often heard awesome things about Momotaro the last couple of years. We were in the downstairs basement area (The Izakaya) and it was a cool space to host 50+ people over a 2 hour span. Nice sized bar area that had its drink menus hanging by clips above the bar in front of the seats...was pretty cool as you had to reach up for it. Very dark and intimate along with cool paintings on the wall. They served us some sushi which was very good; so good that after my event me and my out of town friend from Miami decided to go up and have dinner in the main dining room upstairs.

We went up around 8:30 and the place was pretty packed on a Wednesday night. We asked the hostess if she could accommodate us without a reservation and they had space at the sushi station...that was cool! Got to watch the guys do their thing back their...pretty cool. Our server Essyl came over and took pretty good care of us. Everything on the menu looked great, but we went with the following:

Negi Hamachi Roll  (yellowtail hamachi,tokyo scallions) Delicious!
Tuna Jaga Roll (big eye tuna, chile sesame, pickled onions) Very good!
Go Takara Roll (spicy tuna, hamachi, salmon, madai snapper, akami tuna, hokkaido scallop) Star of the show and damn good!
Chahan (beef fried rice, pickled ginger, maitake) - could stop eating this...amazing!

All food was delicious and we cleared it all out!!! The look of the place is pretty modern with an awesome flair to it. Momotaro is one of my favorite places for all the reasons above!

This was the best Japanese restaurant I've been to period. Evergthing from the food to service to ambiance was incredible. When you walk in expecting some rustic and old place you are surprised by the modern and authentic feel of the place. 

The best thing we ordered was probably the sirloin steak over charcoal. It was cooked to perfection an was probably the best steak I've ever had. The sushi as well was very fresh and simple, just the way good sushi should be. The dish that surprised us the most was the beef skewers which were drizzled in 2 amazing sauces. The beef melted in my mouth and the sauces were exceptional.

Overall, I would definitely come back to this restaurant as soon as I'm back in Chicago and would recommend it to anyone visiting.

Wow. Wow. Wow. Delicious food on the separate vegetarian menu. Great place for a business dinner (classy, clean, tasty, expensive) where everyone will leave happy!!

I had thought Shizen in San Francisco was the only lace in the US that could do vegetarian Japanese food well, but this place proved me wrong. I had a delicious, filling dinner with items from the vegetarian menu that felt more traditional than what I'd get from a vegan/creative sushi place in SF: 

Agedashi tofu (vegetarian) - there are two versions of this so get the one without Bonito flakes! Warm, delicious, soft tofu cooked in a Japanese style

Momotaro Tartare - simple but delicious dish primarily made out of bread and tomatoes 

Chef's vegetarian nigiri tasting - classic Japanese flavors without the fish/meat. Subtle but delightful flavors

Eggplant sushi - great combination of fried eggplant with other ingredients made this something that even the carnivores grabbed for

I chose to come here instead of check out the fireworks on Navy Pier and do not regret it at all! I had a wonderful time and can't wait to come back! Great job with having vegetarian options!!

The sushi here is the best I've had in the United States-- I asked our waiter and apparently the fish is flown in from Japan everyday... 
The non-sushi dishes were also delicious. Very good flavor and beautiful presentation.
Service is generally pretty good.
The only downside is that the restaurant is pretty pricey and the portions are small

Honest review: didnt like it nothing blew me away. The sushi is pretty plain nothing that u cant get somewhere else for being revered  as the best sushi at least do things different and atleast deliver that promise for being the best the service was okay nothing special didnt give good recommendations didnt describe all the food n took away utencils and didnt give new ones took away the hotsauce that they charged for when we still eating n the wasabi i paid for n like we were done eating and waited forever to order dessert
the only thing i thought was worth ordering again was the Hotate and the Brown butter piroquettes theres alot better places that are cheaper n tastier u dont need to spend a fortune for basic food my favorite sushi place is still kaizan 

Mentaiko Spaghetti 15$ didnt like it not as good as mott street. this needed texture really badly and needed something to make it more decadent and needed more of a pop was very bland

Aji yakusugi 12$ (Smoked fish) meh good but thought it was gonna be different the smoke just added smell didnt add any flavor to it 

Curry Udon 19$ (be warned its supper hot when it comes to the table give it a minute to cool down) good but curry was not home made which is disappointing since this restaurant is so expensive. theres pork in here with shisto peppers and theres like a cabbage salad on top. My favorite part is the shisto peppers cause it adds heat n mixed with the curry sauce makes it taste so good just no knife so hard to cut it the salad added some sweetness to it which was good i would order this again jus make the curry from scratch put more shisto peppers n more salad on it

Hotate $18 really tasty i love raw scallops there great texturally and have a great sweetness to them its a good dish but is very one dimensional all the components are sour so it goes well with the sweet scallops however this dish needs some heat to counter act that and something salty too n this dish needs texture badly 

Live dungeness rice $28 good but needed more uni. The risotto texture was perfect supper creamy without being mushy. The crab adds a wonderful sweet component and the veggies add freshness theres like one uni on top which adds saltyness and brinyness i added wasabi and hotsauce and soysauce to make it taste better so it was lacking complexity  

Ogo $6 (seaweed salad)
I was surprised but this was really good. The seaweed has a nice briny salty taste to it and the dressing is sweet and acidic to cut through the brinyness my only complaint add some heat and texture to it

Cedar roasted kurodai (seabream) $30 good but i had better fish in my life. The skin was crispy however the way it was put on the plate the skin on the other side got soggy. The fish itself didnt have a grilled flavor or was that flavorful was pretty bland and was overcooked i loved the sauce it tasted like mint was really refreshing just was expecting more since it was 30 bucks no complexity

Black currant mochi 10$ picture like a pb and j only thing its a kinda basic dessert n the mochi part was unappetizing cause texturally it was supper hard and leathery like fruit roll up

This is one of my favorite places. We usually only go for special occasions (i.e. Birthdays or our anniversary). They are always so great for these events. Since we only come once a year, I tend to go overboard and order half the menu each time. (My excuse is that we won't be back for a while!)

One year for my birthday they brought us the Aji Yakusugi on the house. This is a nigiri that is smoked with the wood of a 1000 year old cypress. It is AMAZING. The best thing I have ever eaten. Naturally, I have ordered this every other time we have been there since. Though most recently I felt that the server opened the lid too soon and did not let it smoke for quite as long as I would have liked! 

Another go to favorite is the Mentaiko Spaghetti - I really like what the egg does to the noodles here. 

Any sushi, be it maki or nigiri or sashimi is prepared with such care and tastes so fresh. You can really just taste the excellence in craftsmanship when you are sampling each item. 

For our anniversary they gave us special menus that said "Happy Anniversary" and they started us off with complimentary Rose since we celebrate our anniversary around Valentine's Day. They also made us beautiful oyster shooters by special request (these were not listed on the menu). I love the intimate ambiance. I also enjoy going down to the Izakaya for a nightcap post dinner. 

I haven't been able to photo document the experiences that well. Too busy enjoying the moment! Sorry for the meh pics

One of the absolute best sushi spots in Downtown Chicago!!! 

From the moment you walk in, you are welcomed with exceptional service and automatically start feeling the vibrant, chic ambiance inside. We didn't have reservations but were seated immediately with a choice of both Sushi Bar or a table. Our jackets were coat-checked which was surprising but a great feature they offer. 

For drinks, we ordered sake, wine, and beer. The 'tears of dawn' sake was amazingly smooth and just the right amount of sweetness. For food, we decided to go with the Chef's 8-piece seasonal sashimi selection as the main dish, along with the Zuke Salmon roll. Our server recommended  a few items from the nigirizsushi and we were convinced and ordered the 'aburi beni toro' and 'aburi otoro' which were both out of this world amazing. The fish literally just melted in the mouth and created a euphoria of immaculate flavors.

If this isn't enough of a seller to try out this spot - I must also add that the fish is SO amazingly fresh- which makes this spot exceptional. Definitely recommend this spot for a fine sushi dining experience.

My new favorite sushi restaurant in Chicago!  Let me start off by saying the prices are steep, but I found everything I tried to be worth it.  I would write a more detailed review of what is in each of the items we ordered, but the Momotaro website's menu seems to need updating (as of 3/25/2017).  

**The sushi omakase at $55 had 9 pieces of sushi and each one was delicious.  We ordered two and enjoyed every mouth-watering bite.  I wish I could remember the names of all of the sushi, but I cannot.  However, we enjoyed every single piece.  
**The Baller at $18 a piece was the best thing we tried.  I feel like I could eat this for the rest of my life...if only I could afford it...
**The Washugyu $14 (shoyu marinated wagyu skirt steak, shishito) was quite tasty
**The Gluten $12 was also tasty.  

All of the drinks we had were also great. We noticed that the bartender by the entrance was very knowledgeable and friendly.
 
Shout out to our waiter, Mikail.  He made great small talk to keep my husband company while I went to the bathroom. Our water glasses were never left empty.  Our food came out on time and he was very pleasant overall.

My husband also received free homemade pocky sticks with sprinkles for his birthday.  To be honest they didn't look that good, but they tasted better than they appeared.  

All in all, with tax and tip, I ended up dishing out close to $250 for two.  We left comfortably full and very satisfied with how everything tasted.  I can't wait to (save up) and come back!

Dinner and drinks here will cost you a pretty penny but it is totally worth it! Don't come here expecting to order California Rolls, edamame, or miso soup. Go out of your comfort zone. Explore the menu. Order that bottle of sake! Ask your waiter for recommendations - and take them! You will not be disappointed. Dishes are small and sophisticated, plan on ordering 3 dishes per person and sharing (if you're nice), so you don't  leave hungry.

I've been here countless times for date night, girls night, birthday celebrations, work events, etc. Momotaro never seems to fail when it comes to visiting for a private, romantic dinner to entertaining a large group. They are extremely accommodating from reservations, allergies, recommendations and overall experience satisfaction.

Momotaro is easily a top 5 sushi restaurant in Chicago. Sure one can find really enjoyable, budget friendly sushi throughout the city, but when it comes to quality, freshness, ambience and service. .. Momotaro ranks among the best. The maki options are limited, so there's no hiding behind spicy mayo, avocado or other fillers to mask low quality or freshness. Nigiri, sashimi and robatayaki are the way to go.

For a more casual dining experience and a great burger check out Izakaya, their speakeasy located in the basement. I highly recommend the hard to find Southern Beauty if you enjoy sake.

I finally ate here! And, although I had a drink or two, I didn't have 6, so I remember what it was like! (see my earlier review).

If you want a cool vibe west loop asian fusion good service good food place, this is it.

My favorite? I think they called it Takoyaki but it wasn't the traditional takoyaki...which is octopus balls. Now, I don't mean the testicles of the octopus....I mean an Osakan treat of chopped baby octopus in a flour ball. Momotaro's octopus came as baby octopus that had been sauteed. If you see it on the menu, get it. You'll die it's so good. Sometimes it's there, sometimes it isn't.

And my drink of choice? Monk's Journey for sure. Vodka based with some additions. Fabulous and strong.

Momotaro came with high praises. Being Half Japanese I was a bit skeptical. I was right. To call this restaurant Japanese is a disservice to anyone thinking they are eating Japanese cuisine. 
First of all the yakitori chicken thighs with scallions was burnt and I mean to a crisp. Also very dry. Of course they are the cook would try to smash it and let all juices out. Then cover it. Never in my life have I seen a yakitori cooked in this way. 
Sushi was okay but the Anago had a fishy taste which means it's not that fresh. We also ordered Kohada nigiri after waiting for almost 30 min was told they were out of it. 
Never will I go back here.

This is one of my favorite places. We usually only go for special occasions (i.e. Birthdays or our anniversary). They are always so great for these events. Since we only come once a year, I tend to go overboard and order half the menu each time. (My excuse is that we won't be back for a while!)

One year for my birthday they brought us the Aji Yakusugi on the house. This is a nigiri that is smoked with the wood of a 1000 year old cypress. It is AMAZING. The best thing I have ever eaten. Naturally, I have ordered this every other time we have been there since. Though most recently I felt that the server opened the lid too soon and did not let it smoke for quite as long as I would have liked! 

Another go to favorite is the Mentaiko Spaghetti - I really like what the egg does to the noodles here. 

Any sushi, be it maki or nigiri or sashimi is prepared with such care and tastes so fresh. You can really just taste the excellence in craftsmanship when you are sampling each item. 

For our anniversary they gave us special menus that said "Happy Anniversary" and they started us off with complimentary Rose since we celebrate our anniversary around Valentine's Day. They also made us beautiful oyster shooters by special request (these were not listed on the menu). I love the intimate ambiance. I also enjoy going down to the Izakaya for a nightcap post dinner. 

I haven't been able to photo document the experiences that well. Too busy enjoying the moment! Sorry for the meh pics

One of the absolute best sushi spots in Downtown Chicago!!! 

From the moment you walk in, you are welcomed with exceptional service and automatically start feeling the vibrant, chic ambiance inside. We didn't have reservations but were seated immediately with a choice of both Sushi Bar or a table. Our jackets were coat-checked which was surprising but a great feature they offer. 

For drinks, we ordered sake, wine, and beer. The 'tears of dawn' sake was amazingly smooth and just the right amount of sweetness. For food, we decided to go with the Chef's 8-piece seasonal sashimi selection as the main dish, along with the Zuke Salmon roll. Our server recommended  a few items from the nigirizsushi and we were convinced and ordered the 'aburi beni toro' and 'aburi otoro' which were both out of this world amazing. The fish literally just melted in the mouth and created a euphoria of immaculate flavors.

If this isn't enough of a seller to try out this spot - I must also add that the fish is SO amazingly fresh- which makes this spot exceptional. Definitely recommend this spot for a fine sushi dining experience.

4.5 stars rounded up to 5

My new favorite sushi restaurant in Chicago!  Let me start off by saying the prices are steep, but I found everything I tried to be worth it.  I would write a more detailed review of what is in each of the items we ordered, but the Momotaro website's menu seems to need updating (as of 3/25/2017).  

**The sushi omakase at $55 had 9 pieces of sushi and each one was delicious.  We ordered two and enjoyed every mouth-watering bite.  I wish I could remember the names of all of the sushi, but I cannot.  However, we enjoyed every single piece.  
**The Baller at $18 a piece was the best thing we tried.  I feel like I could eat this for the rest of my life...if only I could afford it...
**The Washugyu $14 (shoyu marinated wagyu skirt steak, shishito) was quite tasty
**The Gluten $12 was also tasty.  

All of the drinks we had were also great. We noticed that the bartender by the entrance was very knowledgeable and friendly.
 
Shout out to our waiter, Mikail.  He made great small talk to keep my husband company while I went to the bathroom. Our water glasses were never left empty.  Our food came out on time and he was very pleasant overall.

My husband also received free homemade pocky sticks with sprinkles for his birthday.  To be honest they didn't look that good, but they tasted better than they appeared.  

All in all, with tax and tip, I ended up dishing out close to $250 for two.  We left comfortably full and very satisfied with how everything tasted.  I can't wait to (save up) and come back!

Dinner and drinks here will cost you a pretty penny but it is totally worth it! Don't come here expecting to order California Rolls, edamame, or miso soup. Go out of your comfort zone. Explore the menu. Order that bottle of sake! Ask your waiter for recommendations - and take them! You will not be disappointed. Dishes are small and sophisticated, plan on ordering 3 dishes per person and sharing (if you're nice), so you don't  leave hungry.

I've been here countless times for date night, girls night, birthday celebrations, work events, etc. Momotaro never seems to fail when it comes to visiting for a private, romantic dinner to entertaining a large group. They are extremely accommodating from reservations, allergies, recommendations and overall experience satisfaction.

Momotaro is easily a top 5 sushi restaurant in Chicago. Sure one can find really enjoyable, budget friendly sushi throughout the city, but when it comes to quality, freshness, ambience and service. .. Momotaro ranks among the best. The maki options are limited, so there's no hiding behind spicy mayo, avocado or other fillers to mask low quality or freshness. Nigiri, sashimi and robatayaki are the way to go.

For a more casual dining experience and a great burger check out Izakaya, their speakeasy located in the basement. I highly recommend the hard to find Southern Beauty if you enjoy sake.

I finally ate here! And, although I had a drink or two, I didn't have 6, so I remember what it was like! (see my earlier review).

If you want a cool vibe west loop asian fusion good service good food place, this is it.

My favorite? I think they called it Takoyaki but it wasn't the traditional takoyaki...which is octopus balls. Now, I don't mean the testicles of the octopus....I mean an Osakan treat of chopped baby octopus in a flour ball. Momotaro's octopus came as baby octopus that had been sauteed. If you see it on the menu, get it. You'll die it's so good. Sometimes it's there, sometimes it isn't.

And my drink of choice? Monk's Journey for sure. Vodka based with some additions. Fabulous and strong.

Momotaro came with high praises. Being Half Japanese I was a bit skeptical. I was right. To call this restaurant Japanese is a disservice to anyone thinking they are eating Japanese cuisine. 
First of all the yakitori chicken thighs with scallions was burnt and I mean to a crisp. Also very dry. Of course they are the cook would try to smash it and let all juices out. Then cover it. Never in my life have I seen a yakitori cooked in this way. 
Sushi was okay but the Anago had a fishy taste which means it's not that fresh. We also ordered Kohada nigiri after waiting for almost 30 min was told they were out of it. 
Never will I go back here.

Went for my partner's bday on the recommendation of my bosses who frequent here often. The staff was super friendly and helpful and continually would say happy birthday to him, which makes him feel awkward, but I enjoy it! 

The seating was intimate, but in the sense that we were really close to other diners. There was one couple that kept glaring at us every other sentence, which was a bit off putting, since they were maybe 2.5' away. 

The food was excellent, we did the omakase, which was such a journey! We completely let our server choose whatever since we're really easy going in terms of food. The only dish that wasn't our favorite was a seasonal dish that was daikon with yuzu sauce on it, and I believe the inside had miso custard? It was difficult to eat with chopsticks, and although it wasn't off putting in anyway, the flavors were just so foreign to both of us, even though we've eaten daikons and miso on their own. 

We had about 9 rounds of food, including the very, very delicious A5 Sendai Striploin, seriously, it may seem like a bit much at $100, but its totally worth it.  

For drinks we had the Monk's Journey and the Kira Kira, both subtle and refreshing, as well as the Asahi Superdry, which our server recommended. 

Overall, we enjoyed the experience immensely and are looking to get the omakase every time until we've tried the entirety of the menu!

Came by on a weekday night for a solo dinner and was seated right away at the sushi bar (though another solo diner ahead of me got a table). The service was very nice throughout my entire experience. They offered to check in my bag, made sure my glass was always full, and offered menu suggestions.

For my meal I got two main items:
1) Momotoro Tartare (Heirloom Tomato Tartare): This was suggested by my waiter as a "vegetarian" tartare. I was very very skeptical and while I'm not a ready to give up meat, I do have to admit this dish surprised me. The texture is "meaty" and reminiscent of a very chopped up tuna. The taste is like a more nuanced tomato paste (which I know sounds weird but it works). The sweet, tangy, thick tartare pairs very well with the sweet and light Japanese milk bread. Definitely an interesting thing to try once but don't know if I would get it again. (4/5)

2) The "omakase"/ nigiri platter: I gotta say I was very impressed with what I received considering the price. The selection of fish was decent, the quality ranged between 3.5-4 stars, and the toppings to each were very unique. The rice was also fairly well seasoned. The dish itself was also gorgeous. I got the following items for my "omakase". (4/5)
-Hamachi w/ a tartare mixed w/ dried egg yolk: Hamachi had a great bite though the tartare didn't do much for me. Still delicious though
-Akami (tuna) w/ toro tartare: A very meaty and fresh bite. The toro tartare once again didn't do much but it did add a bit of fattiness to the bite.
-Aburi Beni Toro (Salmon belly w/ miso and battera): Ikura was marinated w/ something special
-Beltfish (Tachiuo) topped w/ pickled radish: I don't get beltfish very often so this was a great treat. At the back of my palate I almost tasted the subtle stink of a thousand year old egg (in a good way).
-Chutoro
-Ika to sake: This was a very unique combination of smoked salmon and ika. The smoked salmons is firm and a bit too strong compared to the ika. As a whole, I found the texture was just a bit too tough.
-Kinmedai w/ momiji oroshi (grated chili radish): My favorite piece of the night. The fish was so buttery but still retained the firm clean taste of a white fish. The lemon rind was so subtle but perfectly balanced the oiliness of the fish.
-Sea bream w/ caviar
-Iwashi

Overall, my meal was absolutely fantastic. The omakase was very reasonably priced, the service was great, and they have some very unique menu items. Would definitely come back!

My husband chose this restaurant as part of my birthday celebration. The decor is beautiful, the staff friendly and accommodating. The plates are small, when I say small I mean tiny, so be prepared to order a ton of dishes. The flavors are crazy though! We had the beef tartare, short rib meatball, some sashimi, fried rice, chicken heart, a skewer and 2 desserts. And it was just right. The drinks are amazing too! 

Momotaro will not disappoint!

Recently checked out their izakaya and had a great experience. I had reservations for 9:15pm but was ready an hour earlier so we stopped by to see if they could take us. They were filled at the moment but would happily seat us once something opened. No problem, as we got a drink at the bar. Maybe twenty minutes later, we were seated at a table. Service overall was great. Our server was helpful and lovely and surprised me for my birthday with complimentary homemade pocky sticks. Drinks were very well made. Between my boo and I, we had a divide & conquer, crazy 88 #2, momo-rita, point of view point, this time tomorrow, and a couple of their Japanese beers (not Asahi). We also enjoyed the 'tequila nosedive' experience. Would have loved to try their food, but was still too full from dinner. Easily one of my fav. places in the West Loop/Fulton Market area.

*Returned again the following weekend and the uni chorizo toast was one of the best things I've ever eaten. The toast had the best texture and served the perfect base to the delicious uni. What was awesome was their use of freeze dried chorizo. I thought it might be odd but it gave a nice smoky flavor that complemented the uni without overpowering it. Also, always appreciate the little rundown their staff gives upon presenting their dishes.

Since moving to the Midwest, I've been craving really good sushi so I made a reservation via OpenTable for NYE dinner. 

I love the overall ambience of Momotaro - modern, clean with nods to traditional Japanese decor. & of course, dim lighting that makes reading menus & taking photos of your food difficult - ha. 

Momotaro is the type of place that has $9 miso soup. Ridiculous but a great place for a nice dinner. This is obviously not the place if you want a no frills sushi joint. I am surprised that Momotaro just uses standard wasabi (green paste - typically found in tubes) though. Given the price point, I expected Momotaro to serve freshly grated wasabi. 

We ordered the following which came out to be almost $200 (with tax & tip) for two people. If it's TL;DR: decent sashimi. skip the uni, akami & sushi rolls. kushi yaki/yakitori = super salty but comes with exquisite dipping "sauces." DESSERT - save room. 

*Tuna Zanmai (otoro, chutoro, akami - $21 for 2 pieces of each or 6 total): I hated the akami - it was SO fishy for some reason. I'm sure it was fresh, but I was not a fan. The chutoro was pretty good but the star is undoubtedly the otoro. Melt-in-your-mouth-delicious and fresh! 

*Hamachi Sashimi ($5 for 2 pieces): Solid. No complaints. Hamachi is one of my favorite fishes for sashimi. 

*Baja Uni ($8 for 1 piece): Eh. I've had better uni. it had a bitter after taste and I feel that great uni typically leaves a sweet after-taste.

*Negi Toro Roll ($15): So overpriced but it was good! However, I'd skip this because it's nothing special for $15. 

*Tsukune ($10 for 2 skewers): Tsukune (ground chicken meatball) is a pretty traditional skewer. Momotaro serves its with 2 quail eggs. Really tasty - juicy, good portion - but it was a little on the salty side. The lime wedge & yuzu-based dipping sauce (it was more like a paste) helped to cut thru some of the salt. 

*Gyutan ($12 for 2 skewers): As you can imagine, if you overcook beef tongue, it can be a little chewy but it was cooked just enough for a nice texture. The pieces on the outside of the skewer were definitely more cooked though. I really like the mustard sauce this came with. It also came with a yuzu-based one but the mustard was great. 

*Oysters ($7 of 2 oysters): These were oysters from VA topped with a chili ponzu migonette. Loved the chili ponzu mignonette. There was something really nostalgic and warm for me about the chilli ponzu mignonette flavors. I've never had oysters from VA so I'm guessing they're either more mild (i like my oysters briney) or they dunked them so less "oyster juice"?

*Peach Boy ($11 - kinako gingerbread, buttermilk parfait, pomegranate sorbet): This is the first time I've had a Japanese baby peach and I LOVE THEM!! They're small with green flesh but perfectly sweet. The pomegranate sorbet was also really interesting - I expected a typical tangy but sweet sorbet BUT it leaned a little bit savory. Not sure what spice was in there but it really added a nice dimension especially when paired with the kinako gingerbread. The buttermilk parfait reminded me of a cheesecake. 

*Kabocha Keki ($10 - pumpkin cake, chai ice cream, okinawa hot fudge): This dessert was served a chocolate-coated bar with a layer of chai & pumpkin cake. I didn't realize it was chai ice cream - it was tasty though. However, I wish the ratio of ice cream to cake was a little different: there was only a sliver of kabocha cake at the bottom. I really enjoyed the kabocha cake on its own - there was a nice contrasting hint of saltiness. Love love the okinawa hot fudge - it reminded me of Kuromitsu (brown sugar syrup - similar to a more diluted molasses.) 

Our server, Emillio, was fantastic. Super knowledgable and helpful.

A friend recommended we visit Momotaro during our Chicago visit and we got super lucky finding a last-minute table on a busy Sunday night.  The menu is very much Japanese with some fusion items.  We ordered the Chili Mentaiko Spaghetti, Chili Hama, Negi Toro, and Aji Yakusugi which were all delicious and beautifully prepared, but our absolute favorite item was the Momomaki (big eye tuna, spicy tako, pickled daikon).  I'm not a sushi expert, but this was the best bite of sushi I've ever had.  We loved it so much we ordered another round!

Ambiance is very trendy yet approachable and service was attentive but not overbearing.  Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and made recommendations based on what we were craving.  Next time I'm in town, I'd happily chill at their beautiful bar and order multiple plates of their incredible Momomaki.

Momotaro was a major disappointment. We've walked by so many times and finally went in.

I'll start by saying the drinks were great. 

Overall, however, the food was just average for a Japanese inspired menu. And for the money you should really just make the trip to Kaizan which has 10x the flavor and doesn't take an hour+ to get a few rolls. 

On top of this all, the waitress who originally took 10 minutes to find our table asked how the beginning of our meal was going. We all agreed that the saltiness of the first 3 plates drowned out any possible flavor. One of our guests politely told her this. Rather than apologize or offer a correction or any sort of acknowledgement, she turned to the rest of the table and asked "who else feels this way?"  And we agreed and she walked away and never returned to our table except to ask about desert and give us our check. 

Overall... service with a scowl, good drinks, and good sushi but nothing to write home about or ever return for.

One of the best sushi dining experiences in Chicago. One of the best sushi dining experiences in the nation.

I can't tell you how many kinds of sushi and fine dining sushi establishments I have been with my fianc. Especially on Valentine's Day.

Momotaro is the first fine dining experience that we would like to repeat. Sushi is served at the highest level. I want to say it's the best I've had thus far. One small notch above Sushi of Gari in NYC. The other plates were also great. 

The cocktails were also delicious and not overly strong. Usually I could only handle one high end cocktail before calling the quits. It was nice to experience two. 

If you are willing to spend $100 per person, you won't be disappointed with Momotaro. This is the place to take your closest friends and family for special occasions.

Ambience: Very classy and had a japanese european fusion to the restaurant/bar above -
 intimate lighting, elegant settings and tasteful designs of the dinnerware. My favorite was the Izakaya below, with an oriental gastropub setting.  Highly recommended for going with friends or a nice date! 5/5

Food: Brilliant japanese fusion. I had to force myself to stop eating. I got the tartare (Komomoto beef, momotaro), kurodai fish, washugyu kushi yaki (succulent wagyu steak skewers) and mentaiko sphagetti - every bit of the food was delicious. The  salted caramel icecream and cookie crunch dessert is highly recommended. For 2 people we spent close to 250/- but it was worth every bit of it! 5/5

Drinks: I had the "Hotori Koi" (hope i got the name right) cocktail and it was an excellent blend of sweet and salty lime based whiskey (glenmorangie) - tasted amazing!! 5/5

Too pricey I had better Japanese food.  The valet service atrocious.  I spent 20 minutes arguing with the attendant to please remove the car from the middle of the street made it to my reservation.  Ah.  I did apologized to the hostess for my tardiness.  The service was not good at all the server try to push me to by drinks  and he even forgot to bring our main food.  I was too upset I had my date eat it all.  The only person that gave us good service was the runner because he was describing the food with nice knowledgeable expertise yay. The reason I was upset was that the couple next to us smell so bad it made me feel  dizzy.  I don't understand why wear tons of cheap horrible perfume and you are a man.  
Our server for got of us and all I wanted was the check to get the hell out.  Unfortunately my date ask for desert agh no not returning here the manager did come to our table and asked if we were ok but his jacket was too tide and he had it buttoned up I wanted to tell him not a good look  for this nice trendy restaurant

*Peach Boy ($11 - kinako gingerbread, buttermilk parfait, pomegranate sorbet): This is the first time I've had a Japanese baby peach and I LOVE THEM!! They're small with green flesh but perfectly sweet. The pomegranate sorbet was also really interesting - I expected a typical tangy but sweet sorbet BUT it leaned a little bit savory. Not sure what spice was in there but it really added a nice dimension especially when paired with the kinako gingerbread. The buttermilk parfait reminded me of a cheesecake. 

*Kabocha Keki ($10 - pumpkin cake, chai ice cream, okinawa hot fudge): This dessert was served a chocolate-coated bar with a layer of chai & pumpkin cake. I didn't realize it was chai ice cream - it was tasty though. However, I wish the ratio of ice cream to cake was a little different: there was only a sliver of kabocha cake at the bottom. I really enjoyed the kabocha cake on its own - there was a nice contrasting hint of saltiness. Love love the okinawa hot fudge - it reminded me of Kuromitsu (brown sugar syrup - similar to a more diluted molasses.) 

Our server, Emillio, was fantastic. Super knowledgable and helpful.

A friend recommended we visit Momotaro during our Chicago visit and we got super lucky finding a last-minute table on a busy Sunday night.  The menu is very much Japanese with some fusion items.  We ordered the Chili Mentaiko Spaghetti, Chili Hama, Negi Toro, and Aji Yakusugi which were all delicious and beautifully prepared, but our absolute favorite item was the Momomaki (big eye tuna, spicy tako, pickled daikon).  I'm not a sushi expert, but this was the best bite of sushi I've ever had.  We loved it so much we ordered another round!

Ambiance is very trendy yet approachable and service was attentive but not overbearing.  Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and made recommendations based on what we were craving.  Next time I'm in town, I'd happily chill at their beautiful bar and order multiple plates of their incredible Momomaki.

Momotaro was a major disappointment. We've walked by so many times and finally went in.

I'll start by saying the drinks were great. 

Overall, however, the food was just average for a Japanese inspired menu. And for the money you should really just make the trip to Kaizan which has 10x the flavor and doesn't take an hour+ to get a few rolls. 

On top of this all, the waitress who originally took 10 minutes to find our table asked how the beginning of our meal was going. We all agreed that the saltiness of the first 3 plates drowned out any possible flavor. One of our guests politely told her this. Rather than apologize or offer a correction or any sort of acknowledgement, she turned to the rest of the table and asked "who else feels this way?"  And we agreed and she walked away and never returned to our table except to ask about desert and give us our check. 

Overall... service with a scowl, good drinks, and good sushi but nothing to write home about or ever return for.

One of the best sushi dining experiences in Chicago. One of the best sushi dining experiences in the nation.

I can't tell you how many kinds of sushi and fine dining sushi establishments I have been with my fianc. Especially on Valentine's Day.

Momotaro is the first fine dining experience that we would like to repeat. Sushi is served at the highest level. I want to say it's the best I've had thus far. One small notch above Sushi of Gari in NYC. The other plates were also great. 

The cocktails were also delicious and not overly strong. Usually I could only handle one high end cocktail before calling the quits. It was nice to experience two. 

If you are willing to spend $100 per person, you won't be disappointed with Momotaro. This is the place to take your closest friends and family for special occasions.

Ambience: Very classy and had a japanese european fusion to the restaurant/bar above -
 intimate lighting, elegant settings and tasteful designs of the dinnerware. My favorite was the Izakaya below, with an oriental gastropub setting.  Highly recommended for going with friends or a nice date! 5/5

Food: Brilliant japanese fusion. I had to force myself to stop eating. I got the tartare (Komomoto beef, momotaro), kurodai fish, washugyu kushi yaki (succulent wagyu steak skewers) and mentaiko sphagetti - every bit of the food was delicious. The  salted caramel icecream and cookie crunch dessert is highly recommended. For 2 people we spent close to 250/- but it was worth every bit of it! 5/5

Drinks: I had the "Hotori Koi" (hope i got the name right) cocktail and it was an excellent blend of sweet and salty lime based whiskey (glenmorangie) - tasted amazing!! 5/5

Too pricey I had better Japanese food.  The valet service atrocious.  I spent 20 minutes arguing with the attendant to please remove the car from the middle of the street made it to my reservation.  Ah.  I did apologized to the hostess for my tardiness.  The service was not good at all the server try to push me to by drinks  and he even forgot to bring our main food.  I was too upset I had my date eat it all.  The only person that gave us good service was the runner because he was describing the food with nice knowledgeable expertise yay. The reason I was upset was that the couple next to us smell so bad it made me feel  dizzy.  I don't understand why wear tons of cheap horrible perfume and you are a man.  
Our server for got of us and all I wanted was the check to get the hell out.  Unfortunately my date ask for desert agh no not returning here the manager did come to our table and asked if we were ok but his jacket was too tide and he had it buttoned up I wanted to tell him not a good look  for this nice trendy restaurant

Top Notch and Worth The Spend. 
Deann our server was really incredible, also kind enough to work up a Omakase menu for us with the Chef. Overall the product quality, handling, presentations were spot on are really spoke to a well understood culinary vision. 
Highlights were A5 & Hotate nigiri - O-Toro with fresh yuzu - Tomato Tartar and house-made milk bread - Table-side smoked mackerel with a house blend shiso Yakumi that was very tasty, QUAIL EGG & BACON ROBATA (must have) with smoked peppercorn sauce, King Crab Chawanmushi and definitely save some room for the house made vanilla mochi, scorched peanut and black currant dessert. While the mochi was lacking in the crave-able gummyness of a traditional mochi the execution and flavors more than made up for it, really well done. 
If you read this far its probably important to note that sitting at the sushi bar (as we did) serves no benefit as over the hours we sat there not once did a sushi chef look up to acknowledge our presence let alone provide an opportunity to work through an experience with us. Im assuming this is due to the number of seats in the restaurant vs the number of sushi chefs but a little hospitality goes a long way these days. Don't get me wrong, Im going to go back for sure but for an intimate sushi experience this is not the restaurant. 
For a Japanese concept the warm food was really outstanding.

OUTSTANDING...sat at the bar - we ate here two times last year and the restaurant is still as relevant and fantastic.

we sat at the bar and had great service and they made a KILLER dacquiri with passionfruit, don q cristal rum, luxardo maraschino liqueur & lime. So good i had two!

 Big bar seats and actually quite comfortable!

What did it for us again...and it has been on the menu since the opening - could be my kryptonite...Momotaro Tartare: sweet tomato, japanese milk bread. that description doesn't even begin to describe this heavenly cold appetizer. Just get it. 

Also: Maguro Nuta: bluefin tuna sashimi, miso dressing and wakame. 

I could never work here because i can't prounounce the menu items!!

Excellent sashimi, tasty cocktails, the curry udon and makimono were great and the shortrib meatballs were exceptional.

BUT...the prices at Momotaro are stupid high.  No, not Roka Akor-high, but still, high.  We basically had the food listed above and two drinks for about $130.  I have had other friends that have come for date night and spent $250-$300.  To me, Chicago has better Japanese for much lower prices (for example, I would do Kai Zan or Yuzu before coming back to spend my own money at Momotaro).

That said, the space at Momotaro is beautiful and just sitting inside this place feels good.  At least, until I got the dinner bill!  I'll come back for a cocktail before walking down the street to get food elsewhere, but very glad I had the chance to experience this once.

Oyyyy! I will start with a positive to this review...the service was amazing. Our waiter was so great, he was a 10/10. Every single dish that came out was hard for me to choke down. Im a good eater and I love fish but this was um quite fishy. They call it sashimi but I would call is thick slabs of raw fish. I really was sick half way through the meal. The only thing that came out I did enjoy was the spaghetti (odd at a sushi restaurant). I'm feeling ill even trying to describe the experience. Again, service was great and he replaced a lot of the dishes he could tell we did not care for.

Excellent sushi restaurant! 

We sampled several dishes, such as Miso and the Tako, which was baby octopus lightly charred on skewers with lemon dressing. Our main dish was the Chef's 9-piece seasonal sashimi selection. First impression was the vibrant, yet elegant plating. Great presentation. It just looked delicious. 

From the visuals to the aromas, and, especially the flavors, it was amazing!

The seasonal sashimi was our favorite dish. Each piece was complete, including the delicate garnishes with a brushing of wasabi and soy sauce. They came ready to eat; no dipping or "dressing" needed. The flavors were perfectly pared; all parts carefully combined and plated. All flavors came together like an orchestra with each bite. The sushi was so tender and soft to the palate. Botan Ebi, sashimi, the spot prawn, was so awesome, we ordered more all by itself. 

For drinks, they had an extensive beer, wine, cocktail, and sake selection. Nearly everything sounded good.

Our servers were professional and polite; lady and gentleman quality. They were attentive, neither hovering, nor neglecting. They were vigilant, but from afar. They also brought out steaming, hot towel rolls before our meal to clean our hands. It was a great overall experience!

My one and only sigh, if any, was with our seats. The ambiance, our table, and the overall vibe of the place was modern-elegant, including our seats. They were. however, low and had no back rest. Although these padded stools complemented the dcor well, by then end of our feast, our backs were uncomfortable. Not enough to detract, but I would request a table with an actual chair next time.

Finally, we capped off our experience with a sake and cocktail in their basement bar. It was equally nice, but more hip and completely different in style. Although we were full, it was nice to know, we can come down here, just for drinks, skipping the restaurant above, but also still order from their menu if we should so wish. 

Assuming Momotaro keeps up their five-star service and delivery, we will indeed, gladly, return!

We've already told many friends and family; this is a must visit place!

Facts: I live in the West Loop 
West Loop has some of the best restaurants in Chicago
I have been to Momotaro with a big group a few years ago and was not a fan
My girlfriend wanted to go for her first time to Momotaro and I said let's do it and this second chance completely changed my mind and we had a 5-Star Meal

The Ambiance: Momotaro is one of the coolest I have ever seen. The downstairs bar and bar menu is awesome too! The overall design is stunning. The moment you walk in you are transported and taken on a journey to Japan. Behind the check-in counter there is a giant wood board of all the alcohol options which is really unique. We decided to not take the table in front of the restaurant which was a smart move as we we waited 5-10 minutes and got to sit at a large table for 4 right next to the sushi chefs whom are located in the middle of the restaurant. The diners get to see the sushi chefs shine as they are placed where everyone can checkout their knife skills. 

The Food: Everything was delicious!! Up and down the meal From the start with Robata grill items to the finish with sushi and sashimi, everything was expertly crated with high quality ingredients and tons of flavor. We ordered the chicken and ribeye robata meatballs and the octopus robata too. Thankfully my gf only took a bite of the meatballs so I basically had them to myself which I finished in four bites each respectively. The octopus was fantastic as well. Next up was the salmon bowl which was $30 and huge enough for an entree. The salmon was perfectly prepared and a phenomenal dish. Paired with the salmon, we ordered the smoked Tuna sashimi. The smell of the smoked tuna was incredible and the taste was pretty good- I am not a big sashimi guy unless it is in a bowl. In my aforementioned point about sashimi in a bowl, that is exactly what we ordered next for our main course which we paired with two sushi rolls: spicy tuna and BBQ eel. The sushi roll came with a crunchy topping and this is what Momotaro is known for. The sashimi bowl was filled with raw tuna, uni, roe and rice and was a stellar dish. The sushi was of the finest grade raw tuna and was delicious too. After a not so great first dining experience at Momotaro, this second go around definitely blew the first time away!! 

The Drinks: I loved my Momo-Rita so much that I had two. The flavors of this Margarita were through the roof and not too sweet which is the key to any successful drunk. My gf enjoyed ros and then decided to have some fun and ordered the cucumber cocktail. Both drinks were perfectly prepared and I would go back just to have them again!! 

Pricing: Expensive. So hopefully you saved a couple of dollars as this meal will likely run you $100/person. I would not say the food is very overpriced except for the robata and sushi. The portions are fairly large so you will not be disappointed. I was very happy with the overall experience and had no problem paying for a special meal. 

Overall experience: 5 Stars, 9.5/10. You get it that Momotaro is fantastic and you need to check it out!

My wife and I enjoyed an anniversary dinner here while Game 4 of the World Series was going on, which meant that traffic was amazingly light for a Sat. night!  Since we arrived early, we enjoyed the downstairs bar and liked the Halloween themed staff and candy bowl.  Friendly bartenders and a great variety of drinks.  The hostess collected us at the appointed time and we eased into our seats.  I appreciated the giant mirrors which provided a nice view from the outside seat.  Chic ambiance, too.  Our server was casual and friendly.  Now on to the food which was in the genre of quality over quantity. 

Best: the nigiri pieces were downright sultry and some of the best I've had, including at the Tsukiji Fish Market.  Dungeness crab salad-- the dressing and combo with greens was wicked. 

Better:  waygu donburi-- savory, with buttery beef and perfectly seasoned. Waygu and the shishito pepper yakitori-- a great combo of beef and mild peppers.

Good:  jomaki roll-- ok at $3 a piece, these have to rock, not be the opening act. Shrimp yakitori-- hard to eat and goofy with heads and shells on.  

Overall, a great experience and I'd come back to explore more of the menu.  And the comp champagne as a nod to our big milestone was a surprise and delight moment.

The cuisine is innovative. The ingredients are not only fresh, but exotic. The ambience is sexy AF. This is definitely a place I would bring someone to impress... But chill enough to come with a group of friends, with a reservation, of course. 

Bravo.

Finally tried Momotaro after living in the neighborhood for a year--and it did not disappoint! I went with one other person and we split the Ogo seaweed salad and age dashi tofu to start followed by us each getting an order of the chef's seasonal sushi selection and finally ending with a momomaki roll and 3 nigiri each (botan ebi, unagi, tamago). We're sushi lovers and came prepared for a big sushi dinner--and every course delivered on flavor and presentation.

I highly recommend doing the chef's seasonal sushi selection, a mix of interesting nigiri creations that any sushi lover would enjoy. I would also recommend the momomaki roll, we both thought that it was one of the best makis we've had! Based off of everything we had, I really don't think you could go wrong ordering anything off this menu. 

Hope to make it back for a special occasion!

One of the fine spots in the west loop. This place is hidden on Lake street and you barely know it is there until you are right on top of it or inside the first set of doors. 

The menu is huge and it has the typical shared plates. 

The drink menu is massive with a little bit of everything for all types of tastes. They have everything from fun mixed drinks to rare bourbon and rare Japanese whisky. Very eclectic bar that does not disappoint. 

I tried four different rolls to share and they were all uniquely flavorful. My favorite was the Una-Kyu, it was perfectly spicy and crunchy. I could have had three of these rolls for myself. 

The next best maki roll of my selection was the Go Takara but it was really big just and the waiter said and it was kind of difficult to eat. But it was amazing and was basically 6 different pieces all with their own concoction. I would highly recommend this!

Overall an amazing restaurant with a killer atmosphere and really nice helpful staff. Great spot for a business dinner or a Saturday night out on the town (if you can get in).

Let's start with the pros - nice atmosphere, great service and some of the dishes were great. Cons - The dishes here were really hit or miss - some were fabulous, some were really not good. The skewered meat was delicious and flavorful - the beef, meatballs and chicken hearts were amazing. Not so great was the crab rice with uni (salty to the point of inedible) and the prawns (the batter was so overwhelming and oily, it was not enjoyable at all). Sushi was just ok. I'd go back, but stick to the skewered meats. I will say, the bar underneath the restaurant (Izakaya) was awesome- great atmosphere and we had a sushi roll with octopus that was divine!

Paying for the ambiance not the food here. 

Alaskan King Crab: Good and interesting presentation, but also, if the ingredients are good it's hard to mess up

Wagyu Donburi: Not worth it at all, tastes like food truck meal. Little cubes of beef slathered in a thick strong sauce. Definitely Momotaro's version of the restaurant business CDO (Explanation in The Big Short)

Chili Mentaiko Spaghetti: Absolutely disgusting. Tastes like someone cooked Barilla pasta, POURED lemon juice over it, then sprinkled some of that roe on top. Dude, I can totally do that too, except I wouldn't, because it's nasty. . .

Chef's select sushi: Good taste and good quality but ridiculously overpriced for that level of "good." Katsu is way better in this field. 

Overall: good service good ambiance bad food. If you are going to get creative and appropriate the food of another people and charge exorbitant prices you literally aren't allowed to eff up this badly. . .

Booked this place for my boyfriends birthday on a random Wednesday night. Food was tasty, good drink choices, trendy decor. Standard service. Nothing bad, but nothing remarkable

Very nice restaurant . Service was 5 star! 
Food overall was very good but there were definitely stands out and then those i wouldn't order again /were not worth the price. 
The unagi don bowl.. bowl of delicious rice with eel and eel sauce. Omg order it!!!! So delicious, eel was perfectly cooked, very tender. The chefs selection of sushi was the other wow! The Fish was so fresh ! It was $55 for 9 pieces of nigiri . I also loved our dessert.
My deducted star is for the cost. Now i was expecting an expensive dinner. However a few things just seemed too overpriced. For example $18 for a crab salad which was one of our least favorite items . Small portion and not that great . We ordered the spicy tako roll , $17 , but at least the roll was delicious and seemed to have a good amount of fish on it. 
I recommend this place but you need to order alot of food so expect a pricey bill

First off, thank you to our server for making me feel insecure and inferior on my birthday.
SO....
My boyfriend wanted to take me somewhere special for my birthday so he made a reservation for Momotaro.
He knew this was one of the places I was dying to try and I was so ecstatic when he told me. We arrived about 15 minutes early and went to the hostess area. They were all so friendly and told me Happy Birthday and we were seated immediately. We were shortly after greeted by our server who seemed very bright and cheery (at first) and was asked if we would like any drinks. We both didn't feel like drinking that night so we ordered the Momotaro Sodas; the Pineapple-Togarashi and one Raspberry-Yuzu. After we were brought our drinks, our server came back over and went over the menu. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and her pronunciation was also on point. She gave us some time to decide what we wanted and we went through the menu to narrow down our choices. We quickly decided what we wanted and when I ordered, I suddenly saw a new side of our server. 
She was extremely arrogant and pretentious when I was ordering my sashimi by telling me that I should order the fattier version of the Madai. I explained to her that I don't like fatty sushi and she laughed and said it's a different kind of fatty and kept trying to convince me. My boyfriend told me to get both so I did. That part wasn't so bad but then when I got to the Sake sashimi, she kind of mocked me and said, "I thought you don't like fatty sushi". I let it go and continued to order and again when I got to the Otoro she scoffed and the same thing again. I was shocked but politely explained that I was getting it because my boyfriend wanted me to try it here. Everything I ordered, she had a comment and treated me like I knew nothing. I eat sushi at least once a week, I know what I like and don't like, why was she making me explain myself? So insulting. Not the experience I was hoping to get on my birthday.
In total the food we ordered was: A5 Sendai Beef Tartare, Poteto Sarada, Miso Soup, Chef's Seasonal Sushi, Madai Sashimi, Kinmedai Sashimi, Hirame Sashimi, Sake Sashimi, Akami Sashimi, Otoro Sashimi, Tuna Zanmai, Go Takara, and a dessert that was Peach something with gingerbread.
The tartare was amazing but tiny. Literally, NOT figuratively, the spoon even seemed similar to size as you will see in the picture I attached. The Potato Salad was great and worth the price in my opinion, but you really have to like potato salads. The Miso Soup was not miso soup. It was much more of mushroom broth. It was bitter and I barely tasted the miso. The sashimi was all great, very fresh and very reasonably priced but as expected, I was not a fan of the fatty sashimi, except salmon, I just love salmon. The Go Takara was also fantastic and my boyfriend really enjoyed the Tuna Zanmai and the Seasonal Sushi. The waitress came back over as we were eating and asked what I thought of the fatty sashimi, I told her I didn't like it that much as I expected and she gave me a look as if to say, "you're an idiot." And said, "oh, ha, okay, different people have different tastes I guess, even though most people prefer the fattier ones". Yea, okay I get it, that's freaking enough already. I also noticed that she wouldn't refill my water. She refilled my boyfriend's water, why not mine? And mine was emptier than his each time. I hate her now. Ugh, just ruined my birthday dinner. After we finished dinner she brought over the dessert menu and went back to being very nice. When we ordered our dessert she told us it was her favorite and that we would love it. It was just okay. Not worth it. The dessert menu kind of.....sucked. They also brought out 2 homemade pocky sticks with a candle on the plate for my birthday and although it was nice, I feel like they could do better for celebrations than 2 sprinkle covered pocky sticks.
Although my experience with waitress was less than "nice", everyone else in the restaurant could not have been more professional and welcoming. A man dressed nicely in a suit (Dustin, I think?) checked up on us a number of times and told me happy birthday. Our runner was also FANTASTIC. I wish I got his name. Everytime we got up, he rushed over to the table and nicely folded our napkin, when our server didn't fill my water, he would fill it for me, he would clear the plates we didn't need. He was just on point that night. I wish we could've only tipped him.
Overall, service was 3/5 (the server knocked it down 2 points), food was 4.5/5, price was 3.5/5, experience was 1.5/5 (the server made me miserable).
I don't know if I'll be back. I haven't decided yet. I do think the food is great so I recommend it as long as you don't get stuck with the waitress I had. Wish I got her name.

Went for dinner for possibly the greatest happy hour in the entire city of Chicago: 3 courses plus a beer and a shot for only $25!

Started off with a Sapporo beer and cocktail shot made of gin and citrus, really solid way to kick off the evening.

For the apps we split the chicken karaage (7/10) and the beef tongue salad (8/10). While I would've preferred a light, airy tempura-style fry, the kaarage was well done and came with a delicious shishito pepper and wasabi dipping sauce. The salad was nicely light and acidic, acting as a palate cleanser before the main courses.

The pork tonkatsu (6/10) was a Berkshire pork loin that had been pounded until thin and then breaded and deep fried. It was tasty, but the flavor was one-dimensional as the dipping sauce completely dominated the dish. It also came with a mountain of cabbage that could've definitely used more dressing. 

Next came the sizzling clams (8/10), which the server poured a broth of sake-lemon butter over as they were brought out. The flavors worked well together and the broth was amazing with the grilled pieces of bread that they provided. 

The highlight of the meal was dessert, which were ice cream sandwiches (10/10). I love it when restaurants take a familiar item and turn it into something "gourmet." The ice cream had the intensity of flavor and creaminess of gelato, and were sandwiched between something resembling a dark chocolate brownie. Excellent dessert that was refreshing and satisfying, and a great way to cap off the meal.

Overall it was a solid dinner and an unbeatable value, although there wasn't any dish in particular that wowed me. I would happily return as I think it's a great way to meet up with friends after work and kick off the evening.

Japanese fusion done well. Great ambiance, wonderful service, fantastic food. The main dining room floor is beautifully decorated. The five of us were placed in a booth, and it was pretty busy for a Sunday night, but it didn't feel loud at all. We had a great family-style meal and a great time. 

[Crowd Favorites]
Kumamoto Beef Tartare: A5 wagyu was buttery and flavorful, and the onion crisp was delicate and delicious. 
Live Dungeness Rice: Crab risotto topped with uni and ikura. I could eat this every day.
Simmering Pork Curry Croquettes: Really one giant croquette made with rice instead of potato. Order a side of rice to eat with the amazing curry sauce. 
Mentaiko Spaghetti: Runny egg mixed with mentaiko make the noodles creamy and buttery. Delicious, but a small portion.

[Individual Favorites]
Nigiri: Baja uni, hotate w/ uni, otoro, aburi beni toro. Good, but other than the uni, it was a fusion style nigiri. 
Nigiri Omakase: 8 pieces including the sake toro, otoro, and hotate that we liked, so a good choice for an individual order. 
Alaskan King Crab: Great flavor with cool presentation, but small portion (one large leg, three smaller pieces).
Agedashi Tofu: One big piece with a thicker skin that I found a bit tough, but the dashi broth is wonderful. 

[Not Memorable]
Angel Prawn: Slightly burned and not very notable.
Sashimi Omakase: Other than the great saba, the other cuts were pretty basic with no toro.
Ankimo Nigiri: I usually love ankimo, so this was sad for me.
Green Acres Farm Shishitos: Pretty basic, would have liked some sea salt or yuzu.

[Sake]
Demon Slayer: Slightly sweet, perfect pairing with our food choices, and such a great name.
Dreamy Clouds: Less sweet, great unfiltered texture and finish.

[Dessert]
We ordered one of every dessert, and the standout was the cookie followed by the cylindrical pastry. The ice cream bar, shaved ice, and mochi were only half-eaten, but maybe because we were too full and ready for sleep. :)

Finally tried Momotaro after living in the neighborhood for a year--and it did not disappoint! I went with one other person and we split the Ogo seaweed salad and age dashi tofu to start followed by us each getting an order of the chef's seasonal sushi selection and finally ending with a momomaki roll and 3 nigiri each (botan ebi, unagi, tamago). We're sushi lovers and came prepared for a big sushi dinner--and every course delivered on flavor and presentation.

I highly recommend doing the chef's seasonal sushi selection, a mix of interesting nigiri creations that any sushi lover would enjoy. I would also recommend the momomaki roll, we both thought that it was one of the best makis we've had! Based off of everything we had, I really don't think you could go wrong ordering anything off this menu. 

Hope to make it back for a special occasion!

One of the fine spots in the west loop. This place is hidden on Lake street and you barely know it is there until you are right on top of it or inside the first set of doors. 

The menu is huge and it has the typical shared plates. 

The drink menu is massive with a little bit of everything for all types of tastes. They have everything from fun mixed drinks to rare bourbon and rare Japanese whisky. Very eclectic bar that does not disappoint. 

I tried four different rolls to share and they were all uniquely flavorful. My favorite was the Una-Kyu, it was perfectly spicy and crunchy. I could have had three of these rolls for myself. 

The next best maki roll of my selection was the Go Takara but it was really big just and the waiter said and it was kind of difficult to eat. But it was amazing and was basically 6 different pieces all with their own concoction. I would highly recommend this!

Overall an amazing restaurant with a killer atmosphere and really nice helpful staff. Great spot for a business dinner or a Saturday night out on the town (if you can get in).

Let's start with the pros - nice atmosphere, great service and some of the dishes were great. Cons - The dishes here were really hit or miss - some were fabulous, some were really not good. The skewered meat was delicious and flavorful - the beef, meatballs and chicken hearts were amazing. Not so great was the crab rice with uni (salty to the point of inedible) and the prawns (the batter was so overwhelming and oily, it was not enjoyable at all). Sushi was just ok. I'd go back, but stick to the skewered meats. I will say, the bar underneath the restaurant (Izakaya) was awesome- great atmosphere and we had a sushi roll with octopus that was divine!

Paying for the ambiance not the food here. 

Alaskan King Crab: Good and interesting presentation, but also, if the ingredients are good it's hard to mess up

Wagyu Donburi: Not worth it at all, tastes like food truck meal. Little cubes of beef slathered in a thick strong sauce. Definitely Momotaro's version of the restaurant business CDO (Explanation in The Big Short)

Chili Mentaiko Spaghetti: Absolutely disgusting. Tastes like someone cooked Barilla pasta, POURED lemon juice over it, then sprinkled some of that roe on top. Dude, I can totally do that too, except I wouldn't, because it's nasty. . .

Chef's select sushi: Good taste and good quality but ridiculously overpriced for that level of "good." Katsu is way better in this field. 

Overall: good service good ambiance bad food. If you are going to get creative and appropriate the food of another people and charge exorbitant prices you literally aren't allowed to eff up this badly. . .

We dined at Momotaro this weekend by a recommendation from some friends. We are so happy they told us to check it out because we absolutely loved it! We arrived early, so we headed downstairs for some cocktails. The space is dark and the decor was really cool. Not to mention, the drinks were phenomenal. 

Returning upstairs, we started off with the edamame, short rib beef skewers, and mushroom rice. All three were delicious and cooked to perfection. We requested no mayo on the short ribs and that wasn't a problem for the kitchen. We also ordered the king crab roll, barbecue eel roll, and a bunch of other single pieces that I could eat every day. The fish was fresh and everything was incredibly flavorful. We can't wait to return!

What an unbelievable experience !!! 
Husband & I have been wanting to try Momotaro for a long time & he surprised me tonight with an early Valentine's Day dinner. It was busy for a Monday night & we grabbed some cocktails while waiting. I was happy that they had a great collection of Japanese whiskey- I indulged in Iwai & my fav, Akashi whiskey for the night, while the hubs had a signature cocktail & Japanese beer 

Our server, Ha Young, was attentive, helpful & provided great service throughout the night. We tried everything from each section ... and yes, they have a gigantic menu ...

* momotaro tartare--- wow, crispy texture on top, right Amount of heat

*short rib mitobaru-- holy cow !!! This was one of my fav's from the night- fall off the bone, so much flavor, tenderness & juiciness in every bite. A must from the grill section ! 

*gyu donburi- soy sauce simmered beef over Japanese rice. Wasn't the stand out for the night, but nonetheless, a fantastic dish 

*unagi don- that EEL though !!! It is everything ! My second favorite dish! Butttery, melts in your mouth eel, slightly smoky.. just get it !

*fatty tuna roll - 6 pieces, simple, fresh fish mixed in with scallions. 

*aji yakusugi- finished the meal with this epic presentation. Smoked jack mackerel bathed in 1000 year old cypress steam. They uncover the lid & you smell the herb-like, aromatic essence from the cypress and dive into the tender aji. Perfection !!


Thank you Momotaro for the incredible, romantic dining experience ! It was one of a kind and I can't wait to go back and try the downstairs bar !

Stopped in at Momotaro on a Thursday night for an 8:45 reservation. For the next hour and a half or so, there was a constant flow into the restaurant and there were no vacant tables.

The ambiance at Momotaro was unique - dimly lit yet had a very vibrant ambiance. From the time we were seated the service was great. The menu is expansive - there is something for everyone with hot, cold, rice/noodle and a ton of sushi options.

We were big fans of the Tsukune off of the Kushi Yaki section and the Tuna Jaga and Negi Torro from the Makikono section. 

For those who are a big fan of Sashimi, specifically Unagi, the waiter recommended I try the Edomae Anago (saltwater eel) off the Chef's Selected Sushi section. This was a great alternative and full of flavor! 

Momotaro was delicious and probably one of the best sushi restaurants I have been to in Chicago. The fish was fresh and the prices weren't too bad. Would definitely recommend to any sushi lover

Location: Conveniently located a block from Fulton Market.
Ambiance: Fantastic - the restaurant is beautiful.
Service: I felt our server wasn't very friendly. He either is poorly suited for the customer service industry, or he was short with us because we were one of the younger tables at the restaurant (and I'm assuming expected a smaller tip from us?) He seemed to stare when we made any sort of comment. Understood - he was up for zero small talk. The bus boy was very friendly, but he seemed to be new and a bit confused, providing us with new dinner plates even though we finished our food, only to remove the plates 5 minutes later...
Food: I was pleasantly surprised to see a vegan/vegetarian menu with lots of options! West loop restaurants are great for having separate menus and I much appreciate this - thank you, Momotaro! I got vegetarian/vegan curry ramen, which was good, but not amazing. It doesn't have me wanting to go back. I certainly don't think it was worth $19, especially when the version which included meat was the same price. My friends got many other items including sushi and skewers and although they didn't verbalize it, seemed to be disappointed with the portion size. My friend remarked how she had never seen chicken hearts so small and that they had probably cut them in half.
Overall: Disappointed considering the reviews and expectations that I had. If I feel the urge to have Japanese style cuisine, I would go someplace closer for a better price.

This is such a cute date night spot! When you walk in you have the option of sitting in a lowered area.  Besides the atmosphere the food was amazing.  Probably the best sushi I've had since my Seattle trip two years ago! I love how they put a twist on all their food.  Make reservations ahead of time and get ready to enjoy great food, drinks and service!

I have some mixed feelings about this place but overall it was worth the hype. We started off with the goma ae and it was pretty good, but it tasted overdressed with the sesame, which foreshadowed how the rest of the meal would be. Then we got the momotaro tartare which was very sweet and salty that wasn't too overpowering even if you piled it on your perfectly toasted Japanese bread. We also got grilled yellowtail (don't remember what it was called on the menu) but I was my favorite! It was just so smoky and tasted like the best yellowtail ever. We had the aburo beni toro, otoro and unagi. The unagi was good but I think unagi good almost anywhere because the sauce is the strongest thing you taste anyway. The otoro was delicious but didn't quite have the tuna taste I'm used to and still second to the yellowtail imho. The texture was unlike any other sushi I've had! The chahan was overpriced fried rice and it was way too salty but the mentaiko spaghetti was fantastic. I def want to come back and try more!

Outstanding...from their service to the presentation of their food to the creativity of their dishes.  My husband and I enjoyed our dining experience at Momotaro thanks to our son who gifted us with this experience. We were shown to a large round booth in the back of the restaurant. Immediately we were greeted by a staff member who served us water. Our server Daniel came by to greet us and gave us a few moments to decide on our drinks.  We started with a couple glasses of wine. Daniel explained the menu, made suggestions, was thorough in his explanations and knew the menu well. He also provided wonderful service and was friendly. My husband and I started with the grilled softshell prawns (2 skewers) and quail eggs wrapped in bacon (2 skewers).  I highly recommend both. My favorite was the quail eggs which were soft boiled eggs wrapped with crispy bacon on a skewer. Biting into the salty crisp bacon to encounter the soft yolky center of the quail egg was divine. Next we ordered sashimi which is pieces of fish. We ordered three which came with two pieces small pieces of each fish. We had the tuna, red snapper and unagi. The fish was extremely fresh and melted in our mouths.  Then we ordered some maki...yellowtail & scallion (6 pieces) and king crag & unagi (5 pieces). Both rolls were very good and flavorful. I then ordered a cup of tea and was surprised at the cost of a small pot of tea, which generated two small cups of tea. I chose one of the less expensive ones at $8, but the prices were up to $28.  The last food items we ordered were the chef's daily special which was a yellowtail nigiri (2 pieces) and we also ordered a fatty tuna roll (6 pieces).  The yellowtail was fantastic and the fatty tuna roll was rich and yummy.  Momotaro is definitely an expensive restaurant, but the food is outstanding. Portions are definitely on the smaller side, too. We had $100 gift certificate and spent an additional $75.  This is a great place to celebrate an anniversary or birthday or something special. I can't see going here every other week to get my sushi fix as it is pricey. Make reservations so you're assured a table.

Oh this place is delicious. 

I came here for my birthday dinner and it was amazing. My bf and I skipped drinks since it was a weeknight and we had to work in the morning (gettin' old!). We started with the A5 sendai beef tartare, which was full of many flavors and textures. It was good, however, I kind of lost the taste of the beef because of everything else that was going on in the dish. We also had the negima kushi yaki, which was very tender, and it came with super flavorful dipping sauces. We ordered two orders of the chef's seasonal sushi, aka omakase, and it was sooo good. The fish was amazingly soft and almost melts in your mouth. We ended dinner with Okinawan black sugar ice cream, matcha cookies aaaand birthday pocky sticks. We were stuffed!

This place ruined nigiri for me. I now have no interest in ordering nigiri from any regular sushi spot. (Ok a little exaggeration here, but you get what I mean.) 

Ambiance is modern and cool and service is great. If you enjoy sushi, come treat yo self.

After perusing through Momotaro's food and drink selection, we were eager to dine here for an early birthday celebration while visiting Chicago. The trendy ambiance and the modern feel of the restaurant was something to take in - it was beautiful. I have to say, Momotaro's food was definitely of a high quality standard - the uni and otoro was melt-in-your-mouth amazing. The chili Mentaiko spaghetti was unique and memorable; and the sashimi deluxe was spectacularly fresh. The only downfall was the A5 sendai beef tartare, which was good, but it seemed like a frivolous amount of money for how much consists in a serving. 

Now, I will give Momotaro the credit it deserves for the quality of their ingredients; however, the dining experience felt like it was missing something. For the cost of the meal, the experience fell short of amazing. Upon arriving, the hostess gave the disclaimer that they were running a bit behind. We proceeded to go downstairs to the basement bar area - where it was packed as well and we could not get noticed to order a drink. Granted, it was a Saturday evening, but it took about 30-40 minutes even with a reservation to be seated in the main dining area. 

The timing of the services and the courses/ dishes was super off - there was no coordination and the explanation for the courses was basically read off of what was stated on the menu. The plates were delivered at irregular intervals. 

The hostess called a couple days prior to our reservation inquiring if we were celebrating any particular occasion and noted in her system that we were celebrating an early birthday dinner. I can't begin to explain how disappointed I was when we did not even have that acknowledged. What's the point of asking if we're celebrating anything if you don't even bother to recognize it? No birthday menu. No birthday dessert. Not even a "Happy Birthday" wish. 

Overall, the food was good, but the experience is over-hyped and overpriced. Don't think I'll be rushing back to Momotaro anytime soon.

We dined at Momotaro this weekend by a recommendation from some friends. We are so happy they told us to check it out because we absolutely loved it! We arrived early, so we headed downstairs for some cocktails. The space is dark and the decor was really cool. Not to mention, the drinks were phenomenal. 

Returning upstairs, we started off with the edamame, short rib beef skewers, and mushroom rice. All three were delicious and cooked to perfection. We requested no mayo on the short ribs and that wasn't a problem for the kitchen. We also ordered the king crab roll, barbecue eel roll, and a bunch of other single pieces that I could eat every day. The fish was fresh and everything was incredibly flavorful. We can't wait to return!

What an unbelievable experience !!! 
Husband & I have been wanting to try Momotaro for a long time & he surprised me tonight with an early Valentine's Day dinner. It was busy for a Monday night & we grabbed some cocktails while waiting. I was happy that they had a great collection of Japanese whiskey- I indulged in Iwai & my fav, Akashi whiskey for the night, while the hubs had a signature cocktail & Japanese beer 

Our server, Ha Young, was attentive, helpful & provided great service throughout the night. We tried everything from each section ... and yes, they have a gigantic menu ...

* momotaro tartare--- wow, crispy texture on top, right Amount of heat

*short rib mitobaru-- holy cow !!! This was one of my fav's from the night- fall off the bone, so much flavor, tenderness & juiciness in every bite. A must from the grill section ! 

*gyu donburi- soy sauce simmered beef over Japanese rice. Wasn't the stand out for the night, but nonetheless, a fantastic dish 

*unagi don- that EEL though !!! It is everything ! My second favorite dish! Butttery, melts in your mouth eel, slightly smoky.. just get it !

*fatty tuna roll - 6 pieces, simple, fresh fish mixed in with scallions. 

*aji yakusugi- finished the meal with this epic presentation. Smoked jack mackerel bathed in 1000 year old cypress steam. They uncover the lid & you smell the herb-like, aromatic essence from the cypress and dive into the tender aji. Perfection !!


Thank you Momotaro for the incredible, romantic dining experience ! It was one of a kind and I can't wait to go back and try the downstairs bar !

Stopped in at Momotaro on a Thursday night for an 8:45 reservation. For the next hour and a half or so, there was a constant flow into the restaurant and there were no vacant tables.

The ambiance at Momotaro was unique - dimly lit yet had a very vibrant ambiance. From the time we were seated the service was great. The menu is expansive - there is something for everyone with hot, cold, rice/noodle and a ton of sushi options.

We were big fans of the Tsukune off of the Kushi Yaki section and the Tuna Jaga and Negi Torro from the Makikono section. 

For those who are a big fan of Sashimi, specifically Unagi, the waiter recommended I try the Edomae Anago (saltwater eel) off the Chef's Selected Sushi section. This was a great alternative and full of flavor! 

Momotaro was delicious and probably one of the best sushi restaurants I have been to in Chicago. The fish was fresh and the prices weren't too bad. Would definitely recommend to any sushi lover

Location: Conveniently located a block from Fulton Market.
Ambiance: Fantastic - the restaurant is beautiful.
Service: I felt our server wasn't very friendly. He either is poorly suited for the customer service industry, or he was short with us because we were one of the younger tables at the restaurant (and I'm assuming expected a smaller tip from us?) He seemed to stare when we made any sort of comment. Understood - he was up for zero small talk. The bus boy was very friendly, but he seemed to be new and a bit confused, providing us with new dinner plates even though we finished our food, only to remove the plates 5 minutes later...
Food: I was pleasantly surprised to see a vegan/vegetarian menu with lots of options! West loop restaurants are great for having separate menus and I much appreciate this - thank you, Momotaro! I got vegetarian/vegan curry ramen, which was good, but not amazing. It doesn't have me wanting to go back. I certainly don't think it was worth $19, especially when the version which included meat was the same price. My friends got many other items including sushi and skewers and although they didn't verbalize it, seemed to be disappointed with the portion size. My friend remarked how she had never seen chicken hearts so small and that they had probably cut them in half.
Overall: Disappointed considering the reviews and expectations that I had. If I feel the urge to have Japanese style cuisine, I would go someplace closer for a better price.

This is such a cute date night spot! When you walk in you have the option of sitting in a lowered area.  Besides the atmosphere the food was amazing.  Probably the best sushi I've had since my Seattle trip two years ago! I love how they put a twist on all their food.  Make reservations ahead of time and get ready to enjoy great food, drinks and service!

I have some mixed feelings about this place but overall it was worth the hype. We started off with the goma ae and it was pretty good, but it tasted overdressed with the sesame, which foreshadowed how the rest of the meal would be. Then we got the momotaro tartare which was very sweet and salty that wasn't too overpowering even if you piled it on your perfectly toasted Japanese bread. We also got grilled yellowtail (don't remember what it was called on the menu) but I was my favorite! It was just so smoky and tasted like the best yellowtail ever. We had the aburo beni toro, otoro and unagi. The unagi was good but I think unagi good almost anywhere because the sauce is the strongest thing you taste anyway. The otoro was delicious but didn't quite have the tuna taste I'm used to and still second to the yellowtail imho. The texture was unlike any other sushi I've had! The chahan was overpriced fried rice and it was way too salty but the mentaiko spaghetti was fantastic. I def want to come back and try more!

Outstanding...from their service to the presentation of their food to the creativity of their dishes.  My husband and I enjoyed our dining experience at Momotaro thanks to our son who gifted us with this experience. We were shown to a large round booth in the back of the restaurant. Immediately we were greeted by a staff member who served us water. Our server Daniel came by to greet us and gave us a few moments to decide on our drinks.  We started with a couple glasses of wine. Daniel explained the menu, made suggestions, was thorough in his explanations and knew the menu well. He also provided wonderful service and was friendly. My husband and I started with the grilled softshell prawns (2 skewers) and quail eggs wrapped in bacon (2 skewers).  I highly recommend both. My favorite was the quail eggs which were soft boiled eggs wrapped with crispy bacon on a skewer. Biting into the salty crisp bacon to encounter the soft yolky center of the quail egg was divine. Next we ordered sashimi which is pieces of fish. We ordered three which came with two pieces small pieces of each fish. We had the tuna, red snapper and unagi.

This review is just for the izakaya in the basement of Momotaro

We were just wandering around the west loop looking for somewhere to kill some time, and the sight of a red lantern hanging outside an obscure entrance immediately caught my eye. As we headed downstairs, I had to do a double take to see where I was. This place reminded me so much of Booze Box, the izakaya underneath Sushi Dokku. It was dark and had a bar in the center with smaller tables on the outsides. It looked like a trendier and bigger version of the Yokocho alley bars you could find in Tokyo. After taking a seat, we finally discovered that this was the basement izakaya of Momotaro.

Food: The menu downstairs was different than the one in the restaurant upstairs, but I was definitely more in the mood for casual drinking and snacking, so it was perfect. We just ordered a few things to split.

Pork belly kakuni ramen - It came in a small bowl with a cube of gloriously fatty kakuni pork in the center, then some noodles and grilled onions. Then the server poured in the broth at the table side. The pork was super fatty and the grilled onions were an interesting touch. The noodles were forgettable and the broth was nice and savory, but nothing really unique in terms depth of flavor. While tasty, this ramen definitely isn't on the level as legit ramen joints that specialize in ramen, but it's a nice side dish. 

Wagyu beef + shishito robata - Wow, I could eat that wagyu beef by the pound. The order came with two skewers, each with a piece of beef wrapped around a shishito pepper. The meat was cooked perfectly...insanely tender and juic,y and the pepper gave a nice crunch with each bite. It's expected from a robata item, but I wish the portion was bigger. I wanted more!

Uni chorizo toast - This was the wildcard item of the order. At first it looked like breadsticks with pate on top. The chorizo flavor was very mild and I assumed that the paprika type powder on top was the chorizo. I believe the uni was part of the pastey texture on top of the toast. I'll admit, I'm not an uni connoisseur, so it's tough to describe...but it was cold and savory. 

Karaage - I'd say this karaage was almost perfect. The outside was perfectly breaded and fried crispy without being too greasy. The meat was so succulent that I almost burned my tongue with my first bite from the hot juices. Also, they were boneless (which I learned the hard way isn't always the case with karaage). The karaage also came with a dark dipping sauce. Not sure exactly what was in it, but it was mildly bitter and very smokey. It's definitely not the usual sweet/spicy asian chicken sauce, but it paired well with the chicken. 

Overall, I thought Momotaro izakaya was a pleasant surprise. I usually thought of Momotaro as a higher end restaurant but it's nice to know they have a more casual option available that still serves up solid dishes, although a little bit pricier than what you'd expect at an izakaya.

If you are looking for an upscale and sensual ambience for high quality sushi and Japanese food, this is the place for you. Everything about this place is beautifully and meticulously crafted - environment and food.

I've come here twice and once was with a friend for a small meal and the other time was to try their omakase. I've been seated at the bar where we are able to order anything off their regular menu (a good option for people who don't want to wait for a table and are looking for something more casual). My friend and I each ordered the go takara ($24) which is a 5 piece sampler of their sushi. Each piece was made with care and described in great detail when brought out by the waitress. We also split the mentaiko spaghetti which was rich and creamy and definitely a fav of mine. We had a faintly sweet sake paired with our meal, recommended by the bartender, and were not disappointed.

My second experience doing omakase at Momotaro was beyond words as we got to try the best of the chef's selection. We had some sake to go along with this meal and some Japanese whiskey too though i don't remember the names. Everything was brought out at a reasonable time, not rushed and came with just enough to give us a good taste of the food item.

Though a little on the pricier side, this place is definitely for special occasions where you want to be spoiled by great service and even better food. The area this restaurant is located in is a little dingy but you'll forget about that the second you step inside. Overall, would recommend that everyone tries this place at least once in their time in Chicago!

- Friendly service all around - hostess, bartender, server
- Delicious food - spiced cashews at the bar, toro tartare (the only thing not worth the price tag, in my opinion), 3 orders of beef skewers (added an extra skewer for our party of 3), 1 order of sashimi, & 2 specialty rolls filled our group nicely.

Holy. Though I haven't been to many sushi spots in the city, I very well believe the rumors that this is the best one. The fish is outstandingly fresh and fatty, service is excellent, and the lack of empty space was very telling also. Momotaro definitely provided an amazing sushi experience.

I had a monks journey to drink. It was quite refreshing with the rest of my meal. The rolls we had were the momomaki (my favorite), Kani jomaki, go Takara, and negi toro. All amazing. We also had the wagyu donburi, which was also delicious. 

I had a perfect meal here and would love to be back. Unfortunately my wallet may need some time to recover though!

Went as a birthday gift from a friend. The ambiance was nice.

We choose the Curry Udon because it seemed highly recommended on Yelp. It was tasty but there wasn't much besides the udon. The Tsukiji Donburi is hard to mess up since it has uni and tuna - the portion was much smaller than expected and kind of hard to split. We also orderd two tuna sushi rolls - mediocre, not very exotic in the flavor.

Overall, the food was not worth the price. I was still hungry afterwards.

I am not a fan of large restaurants with extensive menus. There is a bit of a mill effect. Momotaro falls into the category of large restaurant and does have a mini booklet for a menu. However, the service seems to reduce the "get 'em in and move 'em out" feel.

From the sushi, to the nigiri, to the creamed crab, to the whitefish in orange gazpacho to the unagi don, everything is absolutely delicious. Because some dishes come to the table fast, I recommed ordering linearly: order a dish, finish it when it comes to the table, order the next dish, and repeat until you're all done.

Momotaro is a popular restaurant and with it being in "happening" West Loop, it fills up quickly. Even during the middle of the week, it feels like a Friday evening after work. Yes, there is a lot of energy and this becomes evident when you have to talk loudly for others in your party to hear you.

Whenever I am in the West Loop and have a hankering for sushi, Momotaro will be the stopping ground.

Holy. Though I haven't been to many sushi spots in the city, I very well believe the rumors that this is the best one. The fish is outstandingly fresh and fatty, service is excellent, and the lack of empty space was very telling also. Momotaro definitely provided an amazing sushi experience.

I had a monks journey to drink. It was quite refreshing with the rest of my meal. The rolls we had were the momomaki (my favorite), Kani jomaki, go Takara, and negi toro. All amazing. We also had the wagyu donburi, which was also delicious. 

I had a perfect meal here and would love to be back. Unfortunately my wallet may need some time to recover though!

Went as a birthday gift from a friend. The ambiance was nice.

We choose the Curry Udon because it seemed highly recommended on Yelp. It was tasty but there wasn't much besides the udon. The Tsukiji Donburi is hard to mess up since it has uni and tuna - the portion was much smaller than expected and kind of hard to split. We also orderd two tuna sushi rolls - mediocre, not very exotic in the flavor.

Overall, the food was not worth the price. I was still hungry afterwards.

We loved everything about this place. Ambience is causal and inviting, service was fantastic. Food was a culinary experience, I think this is the best sushi in Chicago, we enjoyed every single bite of every dish. They also had tasty desserts.

I am not a fan of large restaurants with extensive menus. There is a bit of a mill effect. Momotaro falls into the category of large restaurant and does have a mini booklet for a menu. However, the service seems to reduce the "get 'em in and move 'em out" feel.

From the sushi, to the nigiri, to the creamed crab, to the whitefish in orange gazpacho to the unagi don, everything is absolutely delicious. Because some dishes come to the table fast, I recommed ordering linearly: order a dish, finish it when it comes to the table, order the next dish, and repeat until you're all done.

Momotaro is a popular restaurant and with it being in "happening" West Loop, it fills up quickly. Even during the middle of the week, it feels like a Friday evening after work. Yes, there is a lot of energy and this becomes evident when you have to talk loudly for others in your party to hear you.

Whenever I am in the West Loop and have a hankering for sushi, Momotaro will be the stopping ground.

My girlfriend and I stopped by Momotaro for some late night drinks in the lower level izakaya bar area. The atmosphere was relaxed with the bartender floating between the handful of people at the bar. The cocktails were unique and tasty, with the overall selection being enough to satisfy most alcohol tastes. If sake tickles your fancy, the selection at Momotaro will keep you busy and satisfied for a while. They also offer a handful of sake flights for the undecided.

Came here last Friday with the boyfriend. The waitress was super sweet and offered many suggestions and carefully explained the menu To us. We started of with sake. It was light and floral. Edamame and miso soup came next. the miso soup is $9 each but it is by far the most delicious I've tasted. The tofu is fried and floating with some small cute mushrooms. We then went for some rolls and hibachi. THIS PLACE THREW ME OUT THE WATER. Best sushi I've ever had. It was smoky and perfect. A little bit pricy but I can't wait to come back!

Love the atmosphere, especially downstairs. The staff is great. The food is really delicious. You will be encouraged to step outside your comfort zone and try something new. There whisky selection is expansive, and the bartenders know all about Japanese whisky. Momotaro recently added a highball machine, and I had the pleasure of enjoying a couple of Suntory Whisky Toki highballs with grapefruit garnish. Very refreshing! Looking forward to my next visit and having washugyu with a Toki highball

Great ambience and great sushi / yakitori! 
- ambience: nice space in the west loop. Interesting decorations. 
- food: appetizer was good, but the pasta was a little bit too salty for us. Yakitori was great, so did chawanmushi!! The best is certainly the sushi tho - so fresh and so fatty! Omakase is not a bad deal ( though we didn't get it. Would strongly recommend otoro sushi!) 
- a little bit pricey but well worth it!

Came here because a Chicago native recommended this place. I came here with high expectations and was not disappointed. From other yelp reviews, I read that sometimes having a reservation doesn't mean you'l be seated near that time. My party had a reservation at 6 PM for the sushi bar, but we showed up at 5 PM in hopes of being seated earlier. We were able to get the sushi bar within 10 minutes of arriving. 

The restaurant is beautiful. The presentation of all the dishes was amazing. Their selection of cocktails, each with an unique name, made me wish I could come back sooner than later. Two of us ordered ala carte while two of us (myself included) chose to get the omakase. I cannot wait to come back here.

For a high quality sushi/sashimi/omakase place in Chicago, Momotaro is it. Since I am from California, the fish was not the freshest I've had but still of high quality. 

I absolutely love tuna, so I ordered several of Momotaro's sashimi cuts. I had the Akami to Negi Toro, Sake Sashimi, and the tekka maki roll. All so soft they almost melted in my mouth. I would recommend ordering the Negi toro instead as my friend's fatty tuna roll was unique and so delicious!

As for my main dish, I ordered the Curry udon. It doesn't seem very popular in other reviews but I highly recommend it! The portion can be split amongst 2-3 people, and the curry was very creamy. I really enjoyed the shishito pepper twist to the dish- a real plus that I may add to my own recipe too. 

The winner of the meal by far was the dessert. At 3.50 each, the matcha green tea double chocolate wafer cookie is unmatched. The sweetness of the matcha green tea blends nicely with the cold dark bitter wafer. This dessert is a must! 

All in all, I'll be back for the romantic ambience and the Omakase (next time!)

Great food, good ambience and a separate but extensive gluten free menu made me happy. Only wish they had tamari (gf soy sauce) for me to have a complete experience. We ordered a lot of food, shishito peppers, mushroom & chicken skewers, Alaskan king crab & various rolls. Chicken skewer was okay but everything else was delicious. I am very skeptical of sushi given my weak stomach but the seafood was exceptional. Definitely going back for a date night.

Glad we were able to finally check out Momotaro a few weeks ago since it's been on my "best of Chicago" sushi lists to try.  I was a bit nervous bringing the baby, but we snagged an early after work dinner reservation when it wasn't too crowded yet.  The space is beautifully decorated.  The host and hostess were very welcoming, checked our stroller downstairs, and gave us the corner table across from the bar which was perfect for the 3 of us.  Thankfully baby was great throughout dinner service and even flirted with the staff :)

The food was delicious.  Hubby and I tried both the Chef's Seasonal Selection of Sashimi and Nigiri.  Don't even play with the sashimi and just go straight for the nigiri.  The sashimi pieces (12) were good, but nothing special and were cut super thick while the nigiri (9) were more creative and had great flavor profiles.  Presentation was beautiful.  Hubby and I also tried the Alaskan King Crab from the coals section which was super delicious!!  The crab was his favorite part of the meal.  I was also pleasantly surprised with the dessert.  The ice cream was great, but my favorite was the cookie with the green tea powder.  It was delicate and decadent.  I regret having to split it with Hubby.   

Service was great.  Everyone was accommodating to the baby and made all of us feel at ease.  Thanks for a great early date night to end the work week!

It's a cute little place, Cozy upstairs for meals & funky downstairs for drinks.
We didn't make a reservation but could order the dinner menu seated on the bar.
Our waitress was so knowledgeable about the drinks, their history AND the food. Her recommendations were spot on. The food was amazing. The wagyu was the highest grade marbling in the world. It was expensive but totally worth it. Crunchy on the outside with a dash of sea salt and it literally melts in your mouth. And the dessert to live for!
The service was of course attentive, friendly, efficient fabulous. The ambience was great for conversations and chilling out. Even at the bar seating. Downstairs is definitely worth a visit, which was what our waitress recommended us.

Call me sushi spoiled, but this was 'meh'...  
I would say that the food was good, but it didn't nearly meet expectations of a famous Japanese restaurant.  
We came in and asked for Omakase selection - we tried two appetizers, a few nigiri pieces, sashimi (very meh), one roll (one was a go back since it was TOO spicy), and a beef dish.

What we left 'remembering' was the Ogo (seaweed salad), una-kyu (eel roll with cucumber and avocado yuzu kosho), and washugyu (wagyu beef, enoki mushrooms and shishito peppers).  

I guess, we should have avoided nigiri and sashimi, and went for the dishes.

hrm. 

it was over 30 minutes of waiting for our reservation at 830pm. no where to stand waiting so everyone is getting bumped around all the time. also there wasn't really a good apology for such a long wait for my 7-top table! i was also unhappy b/c the servers were very quick on the draw and would take away plates before we were finished eating. like they were trying to get us out of there quickly. 

the food came out decently quick. i think we must have ordered the wrong stuff. nothing really impressed us too much. tasted good, but nothing amazing. presentation was pretty, but again, nothing wow. i think we must have ordered the wrong stuff. it's also just SUPER expensive for something so very tiny... even compared to other really nice restaurants.

Restaurant Row in Chicago a strip of buildings along Randolph between Halsted and Ogden Avenue. The area has simply exploded with foodie and elevated (pardon the pun) restaurants. This is where the celebrity chefs spend the bulk of their time and effort. 

Unfortunately, reservations on Restaurant Row need to be done well in advance (sometimes months). But, if you're looking for a place to dine out on a special evening... this is it.

Happily, Momotaro is one street over from Randolph (on Lake) and sits under the elevated transit tracks. It's possible to get a reservation here a couple of days in advance.

The restaurant really packs people in. We were so close to our neighbouring tables that we could overhear all the conversations. At some point we just decided to talk to everyone and our little tables became a community table. We met some really interesting people.

The sushi here is fantastic. It has all the elements of that make it a High Tier 1 sushi restaurant (from the sushi rating system that my coworkers use in various cities around the world). Great presentation, unique offerings, butter soft fish, ingredients shipped over from Japan, etc. I wanted to try everything on the menu.

We did have a lengthy discussion about one piece of sushi that is smoked on wood chips that come from a 1000-year old cypress tree in Japan. Before ordering, we had to get assurance that the tree wasn't cut down in the making of one piece of sushi.

Came here for our wedding anniversary and unfortunately, the food didn't meet up to our standards. We got the chef selection sushi and it was sub par. The quality of the fish was really good but they put so much wasabi that you can't taste the fish anymore. And I am someone who likes wasabi. The rice would fall apart and was dry. For the price that you are paying for, this dish is not worth it. We also ordered the monkfish karaage. They only put 2 small pieces of fish with a very salty sauce and they charged $24 for this. This restaurant is not worth the hype. And definitely not worth the price. I wouldn't come back again

This is probably the best Japanese restaurant I have ever been too. If you are going to splurge on one meal in Chicago, I would recommend this restaurant. The meal is especially enjoyable as it is served in a style similar to tapas, with multiple small and delicious coming your way. My personal favorite dishes were the New York Sirloin Steak, the Tuna tartare, and their meatball skewer (forgot the exact name). The sushi was excellent as well, but these were the most unique items in my opinion. 

The bottom line is if you are visiting Chicago, Momotaro is a must-go restaurant.

I was really excited for Momotaro but very disappointed with my exerpience.

My husband and I decided to come here for my birthday.  We were really excited and hungry to try everything.  We each ordered the chef's omakase as well as the shiitake mushrooms, and the Tsukiji donburi.

We received our shiitake mushrooms, which were really good and the donburi right away.  The don buri was okay, nothing that blew my mind. We were enjoying our meal up to this point when.... 10 mins passes by, then another 10 mins.  When 20+ minutes pass and we have now digested our two dishes and are completely full, we get our omakases. My husband CAN EAT, and even he left 2 pieces untouched.

Omakase: visually so appealing but underwhelming in taste.  The toppings on each nigiris were mostly daikon(radish) based. And with daikon's strong smell and bitter taste, it  overpowered the fish. . 

Our entire meal with tip was a little less than $300. The most regretful $300 we have ever spent. 

Also, spoke to a friend who has been to Momotaro 3 times agrees that dining here is a hit or miss.  She's had once good experience followed by 2 disappointing ones like us.

This is a more of a Japanese-flavored restaurant. It looks the part and have some great dishes. I liked the momotaro tartare, chu toro, uni, eel bowl, and the pickles in the A5 beef (exceptionally good).  The sashimi are passable; all the skewers are delicious but tad bit oversalt. This place doesn't seem to know deal with good beef, so maybe asking the pickles as a side and avoid the steaks. Good collection of sake and Japanese beer.

Certainly some of the best food, service, AND decor I've EVER seen in a restaurant. 

In terms of the food, I tried a plethora of things here (please don't try to be frugal here, you'll be missing out on some of the most amazing food you'll ever try in your life), including:

- Unagi don (PERFECTION for $15)
- Otoro roll (delicious fatty tuna)
- 1 piece of otoro nigiri ($10 each, but so worth it)
-  A5 wagyu tartare (can't even begin to explain)

The biggest standout of the night was the A5 wagyu tartare by FAR. Coming in at $25 for tartare, I expected quite a bit. My expectations were surpassed and...honestly, I've never had tartare like this before. It was simply incredible - the flavor was unlike anything I've ever had before. Not overly savory, but extremely flavorful!

Now I could rave about the food and sushi for paragraphs, but to sum it up - I thoroughly enjoyed every dish I tried at Momotaro! The $55 chef's choice sushi meal looked absolutely flawless, and my friend was equally impressed with it. 

The service was A+! Our waiter was ridiculously knowledgeable and explained the menu items without coming across as pretentious. That's actually very difficult to do in an upscale Japanese restaurant, in my opinion! 

The DECOR. When I first walked in, I definitely audibly gasped. The place has such a classy yet homey feel - not really sure how they achieved it, but it was great! Also, our party got probably the best table in the place - make reservations well in advance! 

Overall, this place was very pricey but certainly worth the $. I enjoyed every second of my time here, and it was not only an eye-opening experience in terms of sushi, but in terms of general Japanese cuisine. I'd say that I'm a pretty big connoisseur of Japanese foods, and this took it to another level.

Fiance and I came here last night for our 9 year anniversary dinner. As usual, Momotaro did not disappoint! Our waiter was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. We did the sashimi omakase again and wow, did we get some tasty fish! I loved the uni wrapped in beef tartare and could eat a whole plate of that. We also had the chicken heart skewers, edamame, potato crusted calamari and chocolate mousse. I liked how the timing of our dishes was spaced. We had enough time to eat and didn't wait super long for the next dish. Our waiter gave us a glass of prosecco and pocky to celebrate our anniversary. He was awesome and really made our anniversary dinner special!

This is the kind of dining experience I was hoping for when we had my birthday dinner at another Asian restaurant in the area. I'm not taking about freebies, but the attentiveness of the staff and quality of food for the price point. We never had to sit ignored for 30+ minutes without a drink or food.

The meal is especially enjoyable as it is served in a style similar to tapas, with multiple small and delicious coming your way. My personal favorite dishes were the New York Sirloin Steak, the Tuna tartare, and their meatball skewer (forgot the exact name). The sushi was excellent as well, but these were the most unique items in my opinion. 

The bottom line is if you are visiting Chicago, Momotaro is a must-go restaurant.

I was really excited for Momotaro but very disappointed with my exerpience.

My husband and I decided to come here for my birthday.  We were really excited and hungry to try everything.  We each ordered the chef's omakase as well as the shiitake mushrooms, and the Tsukiji donburi.

We received our shiitake mushrooms, which were really good and the donburi right away.  The don buri was okay, nothing that blew my mind. We were enjoying our meal up to this point when.... 10 mins passes by, then another 10 mins.  When 20+ minutes pass and we have now digested our two dishes and are completely full, we get our omakases. My husband CAN EAT, and even he left 2 pieces untouched.

Omakase: visually so appealing but underwhelming in taste.  The toppings on each nigiris were mostly daikon(radish) based. And with daikon's strong smell and bitter taste, it  overpowered the fish. . 

Our entire meal with tip was a little less than $300. The most regretful $300 we have ever spent. 

Also, spoke to a friend who has been to Momotaro 3 times agrees that dining here is a hit or miss.  She's had once good experience followed by 2 disappointing ones like us.

This is a more of a Japanese-flavored restaurant. It looks the part and have some great dishes. I liked the momotaro tartare, chu toro, uni, eel bowl, and the pickles in the A5 beef (exceptionally good).  The sashimi are passable; all the skewers are delicious but tad bit oversalt. This place doesn't seem to know deal with good beef, so maybe asking the pickles as a side and avoid the steaks. Good collection of sake and Japanese beer.

Certainly some of the best food, service, AND decor I've EVER seen in a restaurant. 

In terms of the food, I tried a plethora of things here (please don't try to be frugal here, you'll be missing out on some of the most amazing food you'll ever try in your life), including:

- Unagi don (PERFECTION for $15)
- Otoro roll (delicious fatty tuna)
- 1 piece of otoro nigiri ($10 each, but so worth it)
-  A5 wagyu tartare (can't even begin to explain)

The biggest standout of the night was the A5 wagyu tartare by FAR. Coming in at $25 for tartare, I expected quite a bit. My expectations were surpassed and...honestly, I've never had tartare like this before. It was simply incredible - the flavor was unlike anything I've ever had before. Not overly savory, but extremely flavorful!

Now I could rave about the food and sushi for paragraphs, but to sum it up - I thoroughly enjoyed every dish I tried at Momotaro! The $55 chef's choice sushi meal looked absolutely flawless, and my friend was equally impressed with it. 

The service was A+! Our waiter was ridiculously knowledgeable and explained the menu items without coming across as pretentious. That's actually very difficult to do in an upscale Japanese restaurant, in my opinion! 

The DECOR. When I first walked in, I definitely audibly gasped. The place has such a classy yet homey feel - not really sure how they achieved it, but it was great! Also, our party got probably the best table in the place - make reservations well in advance! 

Overall, this place was very pricey but certainly worth the $. I enjoyed every second of my time here, and it was not only an eye-opening experience in terms of sushi, but in terms of general Japanese cuisine. I'd say that I'm a pretty big connoisseur of Japanese foods, and this took it to another level.

Fiance and I came here last night for our 9 year anniversary dinner. As usual, Momotaro did not disappoint! Our waiter was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. We did the sashimi omakase again and wow, did we get some tasty fish! I loved the uni wrapped in beef tartare and could eat a whole plate of that. We also had the chicken heart skewers, edamame, potato crusted calamari and chocolate mousse. I liked how the timing of our dishes was spaced. We had enough time to eat and didn't wait super long for the next dish. Our waiter gave us a glass of prosecco and pocky to celebrate our anniversary. He was awesome and really made our anniversary dinner special!

This is the kind of dining experience I was hoping for when we had my birthday dinner at another Asian restaurant in the area. I'm not taking about freebies, but the attentiveness of the staff and quality of food for the price point. We never had to sit ignored for 30+ minutes without a drink or food.

So got a reso for momotaro izakaya and unbeknownst to us, they are no longer offering the same menu as upstairs at momotaro.

Very upset that we couldn't get some of our favorite dishes there but did try some new items.

Whiskey flight- long journey: would recommend
Spicy tuna & octopus roll- the big eyed tuna on top was so fresh
Pork tonkatsu - really filling
Chicken karaggee - good but small app
Spicy beef ramen - lots of ramen but not the best we've had 

Service was good!

Wow, I understand the hype now. 

Emilio, our server, was absolutely endearing. Attentive, funny and thorough. He explained the whole menu in less than 20 minutes! (Inside joke)

The Ambience:
This restaurant is surreal. Trendy, modern, fresh and hip. The breathy lounge background music and bustling of the guests invigorates your dining experience. On top of that, the beautiful centerpiece lighting and airport timetable menu wall behind the bar, this place is impressively architected. 

The Food: 
Complete fan of their nigiri and maki rolls. What makes this place stand out from other Japanese restaurants is their fresh unique fishes. Emilio mentioned that they serve rare meats such as the aji and sailfish. Total fan of their tender sashimi pieces. 

My Picks: (1) Akami to negi toro. A mouthful of fragrant, tender, unami invoking wonder. (2) Chili Hama. The fried potato straws on top of sesame-oiled maki is A+.

Great food and ambiance. It's located in the west loop. Decor and ambiance is good for dates, family dinner, or come with friends. People dress up as well as causal (but still nice) in here. Friendly staff, good service. 

My boyfriend picked this place for my birthday dinner. It's a very popular place. He called a week ahead to book a reservation for Saturday and the only availability was at 4:30pm. The restaurant called to confirm the reservation and asked if it's a special event. 

We ordered quite a few things and we liked them all. I especially like the chef sashimi selection, Momotaro sushi roll, and the curry udon. I also received a complimentary snack with candle for my birthday :)

I really don't understand what all the rave is about this restaurant. All my friends love this place, but honestly I would not go back. The tartare and hamachi I had was extremely fishy, to the point that I couldn't eat it. The sushi was just okay. And everything was extremely salty. Only reason for 3 stars is because the service was really great,  however the food was underwhelming.

This place was really excellent - everything from the cocktails to the food and the decor were spot on.  Very trendy and great vibe - very similar to that of a popular place in NYC or LA.

In terms of food, I absolutely loved the following dishes and would highly recommend these:
Chawan Mushi - steamed egg with king crab and black truffle
Aburi Buri - lightly seared hamachi
Alaskan King Crab - grilled over coals, really nice buttery flavor with subtle spice
Curry Udon - reminded me of japanese curry but with noodles instead of rice
Chef's Special Nigiri - all of the pieces were excellent

Cannot wait to come back here again.  Definitely make reservations as this place does get busy.  Still need to check out the bars up/downstairs.

The evening at Momotaro started well when I arrived before others in my party and was asked, understandably and as usual, to hang out until my entire party had arrived.   I could have gone to the bar downstairs but chose to stand near the entrance.  While I was there a manager came over, introduced himself, and welcomed me.  Almost every employee who passed by greeted me in some way.   My dining companions arrived after just a few minutes, and we were seated immediately.

Our waiter was young and chatty.  He was also very helpful and well informed about both the menu and the wine list (and wine in general).  Both the waiter and the service in general was top notch.  The food was variable but always at least OK.  The Maki were ordinary (I'm no authority on sushi but my guess is the shashimi and sushi here is very authentic and fresh; didn't try the shashimi).  Their small-portion take on Spaghetti was great, as was the tomato tartare (much better and more flavorful than it sounds).  The tomatoes were dense (not watery at all), with the flavor of tomato paste (in a good way); the dish was different and very tasty  (all thee bites of it :-).   Roasted sea bream was served with a subtle herb sauce; cooked perfectly and very good.

Strangely they have a gluten-free menu but no gluten-free soy sauce.  Apparently the chef isn't a fan of gluten-free soy and bans it from the restaurant.  Also apparently he views his customers with a touch of disdain.

The room is handsome (don't even notice the somewhat disguised acoustical tile ceiling) and less noisy than many modern restaurants (thanks, acoustical tiles).

The stars only go for the sake. 

I've been for dinner before and thought it was just fine, but overpriced and overhyped.

I only come back when I get the itch for some sake.

So I did this past weekend but wanted something sweet having just come from dinner.

The bartender recommended the cherry dessert. This cherry dessert is in one word, unconstitutional. It was made of 5 sugar drenched cherries, cut in half. With a spoon scoop of ice cream on the side. What the? My friend and I at least got a kick out of how pathetic it was. A total waste of a "cheat treat."

We finished our sake and went to bar Siena for some donuts--delish.

Beautiful decor.  The service was excellent.  Very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. We were seated upstairs which has a cool vibe with all the old yearbook style photos on the wall.

Everything was marvelous.  

Edamame. I don't usually care for it but theirs is special. Served warm it is moist and salty. The server said they marinate it in brine. It certainly makes a difference!

Miso soup was great.

Goma Ae. I found it a bit bitter but the sauce was good.

Shortrib mitoboru. Must have! Amazing how it melts it your mouth.

Curry Udon. Wonderful complex curry flavor. Noodles done nicely.

Chili Hama Momomaki--excellent rolls.

This update is for the main restaurant. 

The food: 5/5. We finally made it to Momotaro for sushi and it was hands down the best fish I've had in Chicago. We tried a variety of meat skewers, which were great and a fried tofu appetizer, which impressed my foodie in arms. I tried the three types of tuna they offer (akami, chutoro and otoro), as well as madai and hirami and basic negi toro rolls. The tuna was amazing, it was cut properly and the sushi rice had a perfect combo of vinegar and salt, very similar to what I've tried at places at the Tsukiji market. 

The service: 4/5. The service was generally very prompt and attentive. Our waiter was fine, but he got annoyed with us when we asked about the details on the chef's sushi selection. 

Overall: 4.5/5. I highly recommend this restaurant to sushi purists.

O.M.G. - This place absolutely blew me away. First, the decor is stunning - the ambiance works for just about any occasion. The hostess greeted us amid a bar that was packed solid. The downstairs lounge was closed for a private event and so we asked for a recommendation for a drink since we were early for our reservation. She made a perfect recommendation just a couple blocks down and, when we returned promptly for our reservation, we were immediately seated.

After sitting down, the server came over with knowledge, professionalism, and enthusiasm. We started with cocktails, delicious. The server coursed everything out for us. We started with edamame and the benito tataki, followed by the washygyu, then the momomaki, then the alaskan king crab over a smoking coal, finished with 4 pieces of chef selected sashimi - it literally melted in my mouth. We accompanied everything with the server's suggestion of sake. 

The entire experience was just that: an experience. Our table was cleared and we had 3 rounds of new plates - somehow, we felt like we were the only table in the room for the level of attentiveness everyone constantly showed us. The dish presentations were artistic and functional. Even the jasmine blossom tea at the end was beautifully presented and hauntingly delicious. We had such a wonderful time and the food will be tough to beat in this world-class city. 

We can't wait to come back!

Brought my dad to this restaurant and we both enjoyed it. It our first time eating here.We had the "Sorry I'm drunk" roll, the sweet potato roll, baked mushrooms, bang bang shrimp, and the beef short rib. 

Everything was so good. I especially liked the mushrooms. Only complaint was that our table was kind of small, I guess if we only had a roll each and 1 appetizer it would have been okay.  We were the first ones in at 12 and it filled up quickly after that but I noticed that seats were being replaced steadily, maybe because it was lunch time. This is on my list to visit again.

I've been here multiple times and it seems to be going downhill each time. 

Two times ago, my date received the incorrect roll, and the server assured us it was the right one but it was not even close. He refused to complain any further and just ate it because it took so long to come and he didn't want to make a fuss and bother with it any longer.

This past time, I took a client out for lunch and he ordered a lunch special with hot items, and I, a poke bowl. He was served his hot entree roughly 10 minutes before my poke bowl. He refused to eat before my food came, so his food just sat there and got cold. Smh. 

I LOVE the music and the food is usually pretty good - I just think the service and quality is slipping due to popularity. It was also FREEZING there this past time.

This review is not really for food or service. I have celiac disease and I called in to check if they have any gluten free options. I also if the lady on phone can give me some details as their menu is not available online. 

She said they have tons of options and can also make almost all sushi gluten free. I specifically asked if she can clarify and she mentioned our chefs will try our best to get you gluten free items. Excited we left for the place and once we reached there, I was told that almost everything on the menu was not gluten free and I can only have sashimi! Oh for Robata they can give me grilled veggies. 

It was so frustrating, as we were quite far and came in only after confirming to find out nothing is available that I can eat. We left without eating anything. Eating out with celiac is not easy but experiences like these make the process even more challenging. Not for celiac people.

I came across this place via Instagram. Saw so many cute posts that I wanted to try it out. My friend suggested the place so I was up for trying. 

We ordered tator tots, thug life jumbo sushi, sashimi gold, and Midway roll. Tator tots wasn't anything special. Thug life was good. I love the salmon skin! Super crispy! Sashimi gold was delicious except i thought it was odd to only have one cut on some fish. The Midway roll was not my favorite. But if you want something deep fried... definitely check it out. 

It is also BYOB if you want to bring a bottle of wine! 

Service was ok. They brought out the check before even asking us if we want dessert! How rude! I had to ask her for dessert after we paid. We didn't want it to ruin our night. 

The pricing is high but my friend said its the norm around Chicago. 13-19 dollar for a jumbo roll. You're really paying for the art work. We each paid around $45 including tip each but I wasn't satisfied at the end.

Some of the best sushi I've had. We arrived after dinner rush so didnt have to wait at all but expect to wait an hour or so if coming without a reservation. Yuzu has a nice vibe and quick service so food comes out quick. We got the tuna poke, salmon sashimi, born to chill and 1000 ways. Everything was great but born to chill and tuna poke were phenomenal. Def recommend!

I love this place! I am a big fan of sushi and it was so nice to see our meal transformed into artwork! The jumbo rolls are indeed large and filled with filling more than rice, which is something that I watch for when eating out. The beef and chicken were perfectly grilled and well seasoned. The lunch special pricing was reasonable and the portions were plentiful. I also enjoyed checking out the anime on the wall during our short wait for our food. The staff here are attentive and speedy with service. Can't wait to take more of my friends here for a unique sushi experience!

I'm going to start off by saying I'm not a sushi fan. I don't hate it, but it's just not my thing. My boyfriend on the other hand is obsessed. We came here for dinner and I'm really glad we read the reviews beforehand and made a reservation because it was packed. 

I tried a few things from the Robata Grill menu and thy were pretty good. I had the pork shoulder, the scallops, and the steak. Tasty, but you don't get a whole lot with each portion.

My boyfriend ordered a bunch of different kinds of sushi and really enjoyed it. I tried a couple as well and they were pretty good as far as sushi goes (again, not a sushi fan).

The food and service were both good, but the price point is pretty high in my opinion. With the amount our bill came to, we could have gone to a steakhouse and gotten a couple courses. With all the sushi places in the city, it's definitely on the pricier side.

We made a reservation the day of for a Friday night dinner for 6 people and the only available time was 5:30 pm. Due to traffic, we arrived about 30 minutes late yet they were still accommodating (of course we called them when we were in the car that we were arriving late). They simply told that we must finish eating by 7 pm which was totally doable! Why, you ask?

Because they have amazingly quick service! I was seriously impressed! Our food came about 5 minutes after placing the order. The jumbo sushi rolls were lovely to look at with the designs they make with the sauce. I enjoyed the boy meets world jumbo roll which includes spicy tuna and mango - loved the sweetness of the mango in each bite. My favorite though - hands down - was the Riverwalk jumbo roll! The food overall was very enjoyable both taste and appearance wise!

Heads up: If you come with a group, the max number of credit cards that can be used is 3 which may make things a bit inconvenient. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend this place and be sure to make a reservation.

I went here with a friend because we heard good things about the restaurant. However, I thought the food was very average. I think everyone loves the dishes for the crazy decorations they do with the sauces. I totally agree that this made it a unique and fun experience. However I felt that there wasn't anything particularly special to the taste of the rolls. The sauce seems to be only for decorational purposes and not particularly intended to complement the flavor of the dish. We only tried the sushi but some of the other tempura and appetizer dishes the table around us were ordered looked fine and did not have the crazy sauce art.

I liked the lively atmosphere but with the chic dark wood tables and the high ceilings. It was also BYOB which is rare for a nicer restaurant so that was a plus. I only

When I walked by one night with a friend, Yuzu was hopping. The entire place was packed and the food looked stunning from the door. We came back and unfortunately Yuzu didn't really meet those expectations.

Inside, it's extremely loud. I could barely hear my friend across the 1 foot table. Similarly, the couple on a first date were repeating things to each other. The ambiance was not particularly outstanding either - it reminded me of much more casual (and let's get real... cheaper!) sushi places in Philadelphia. 

I started off with the Bang Bang Shrimp, which didn't make much of an impression. Next up was the Black Sea roll, which was not at all dissimilar to the standard grocery-store sushi you might find in a suburb. Not bad, but not that great either. The Naruto on fleek roll was much more successful, with a really nice combination of sauces. 

Service was decent although my friend felt a little bit rushed for a pricey meal. Overall, I would go back without much argument (and order the pricier specialty rolls) if someone else recommended it. That said, I would not probably go out of my way to come back.

This place was awesome! Definitely a hidden gem. The sushi was very tastey and came on beautiful platters and dressed up. I really appreciated the creativity. This place is also BYOB which is fun and they open the bottles for you. it's a bit tight inside but super cozy and a great spot to just go with friends for a girls night. It can be a bit loud but always a great type of place to start your night!

Bomb sushi art & BYOB. What more could you want?!

Made reservations ahead of time, which I highly recommend since the place was pretty busy on a Thursday evening. The place itself had a trendy but casual vibe. Great spot to come with small group of friends or for a laid-back date. Took a glance at their menu and I couldn't wait to order. They have a fine selection of sushi rolls and robatas to choose from.

We shared a few rolls including the black sea, what's my name?, my favorite midwest roll, and #thuglife2. Some of the "ordinary rolls" were better than others. Next time I'll probably spend a few extra bucks for more of their speciality jumbo rolls. Their #thuglife2 roll comes with salmon, jalapeno, avocado, cucumber, topped with ikura, pickled red onion, and unagi sauce. I also tried the pork shoulder robata. The honey garlic marinate flavor was on point, but it was quite pricey ($4) for just one skewer.

From the massive murals of Japanese comics to their creative sushi rolls, Yuzu is definitely worth the visit.

People are not lying here, make a reservation, it is always busy.

But reservations are easy to come by, we called a few hours beforehand and got one, no problem.

It's a solid, energetic, casual sushi spot. There's anime on the walls, wooden tables, and quick service. Plus, a damn fine menu of sushi and robata (or grilled skewers). I got a crunchy Boston roll and a shrimp tempora, and both were fresh, lightly breaded and delicious. 

Also, it's BYOB, which is really the killer portion of this spot. Bring drinks or buy across the street and enjoy all the delicious sushi. 

We had an excellent sushi meal here and I walked away stuffed and happy.

Fantastic dinner spot for quality sushi!! We were able to get a reservation for 5 a day prior, which is sometimes tough to do for a Friday or Saturday. We got there and it was packed! Lots of people waiting both inside and outside. 

The menu is pretty big-- not only do they have lots of sushi options, but they also have some pretty original shareables. We got some rolls for the table as well as a couple skewers. My one complaint is that their jumbo rolls are pretty expensive and they're all pretty original style, but don't have a lot of fish options. Pretty basic protein choices. Also, their classic rolls are pretty basic with not too many protein options either. 

We somehow got away with a reasonably priced meal and being pretty stuffed. They do AWESOME art with their sauces which just adds to the presentation for sure. Also, byob!

My boyfriend and I went to Yuzu on a random Tuesday night for some sushi last week and were pleasantly surprised.  This is definitely not your basic sushi carryout place where the vibe in the restaurant isn't good and no one ever stays to eat.  It's almost too far in the opposite direction with pretty loud music and crowded seating.  We found it slightly hard to talk to each other because of the noise, but that was not just the music but also a very loud party to our left and across from us.  Bottom line - Don't come here for a quiet Tuesday dinner; only when you're in the mood for some lively dining.  

The food also exceeded our expectations - very good presentation and with all the different types of dishes on the menu they were all executed very well.  We got a couple appetizers and did the chef's selection sushi platter and I enjoyed everything.  

The reason this restaurant lost a star for us was because of the service.  Our server was not very attentive for taking our order and then completely disappeared at the end of the meal.  We waited for almost 20 minutes for our check and finally flagged down someone else who closed our tab.  Overall, I would recommend this place and I would go back; great River West/Ukrainian Village spot.

Sad to say, I had never heard of this place and when the opportunity was introduced to me and I saw it had well over 1000 reviews I was excited to try it. We did the right thing and made a reservation as the place gets very busy. Yep, it was pretty busy on a Tuesday evening!

Its a BYOB joint so we had a couple of bottles of wine. We stated out with a seaweed salad and shishito peppers which were delicious! We then did a couple of rolls:

Black Sea which includes Tuna, super white tuna, salmon, hamachi, sunflower seeds,scallions, kani kama, masago, spicy mayo, sesame oil & black tobiko.
Was very good and the best of the 2 that we had

Boston Crunchy which includes Tuna, avocado, chili sauce, masago mayo & tempura crumbs
Was ok, but the Black Sea was that much better!

We then ordered a side of Korean beef short ribs which was just as good as anything we had eaten.

Good solid spot for sushi...definitely recommended!

My girlfriend was super excited for this place and I have to admit so was I.  The reason being is how they decorate the plate with the sushi they serve. In my eyes creative and taste is always a must try. 

You do have to order certain sushi on the menu to get the  presentation but who cares do it. Very friendly staff and we did see some pictures on how they could decorate the dish with the sauces.  Have to say they were very good and noticeable. The dish I ordered came out with a Phoenix and my girlfriend came out with a vibrant fish. 

It is outside of Chicago on the west side but make the drive and enjoy really good sushi

Packed on a Wednesday night at 730 PM! We were glad to have made reservations.

Tuna poke was awesome, nicely accented with white onions and sesame oil. Paired with avocado.
The ROBATA- beef short ribs, bacon scallop and pork shoulder were DELICIOUS!
Totally enjoyed the #ThugLife2 with house marinated salmon, crispy salmon skin, jalapeno, avocado, cucumber, cilantro & topped with ikura, red onions, chili oil & unagi sauce.

Presentation of our dishes were prime time. Majorly IG worthy.

Dim, romantic lighting with candles and some nice r&b music. Brick/wood walls and a metal ceiling. Very, very cool. Just go.

I give this place a 4 for the sushi artwork. I've never seen anything like this before. The designs are unique and vibrant. 

I also give this place a 3 for food. Although it's beautifully designed, the taste of the rolls are good, not great. The taste doesn't leave me wanting more, but feeling satisfied. 

The tator tots were my favorite and I still crave them. I'll order anything with aioli. 

The poke bowl was also delicious. This is also worth ordering.

I'd been wanting to come to Yuzu for a while and I'm so glad I did! My friend and I got reservations for a Friday night. getting one was fairly easy, and i definitely would recommend getting one because when we got there the place was packed! and apparently some people were upset bc they had reservations for earlier and they still ended up waiting...yikes. 
Anyway, my friend ordered the miso soup and i ordered a chicken skewer as our appetizers. honestly i wish i had ordered more things off the menu! it's extensive and everything sounded good. for sushi i got breaking bad and my friend got the la vien rose. i'm not the biggest fan of ginger so i ended up picking all of it out bc the taste was too strong for me otherwise i'd get it again! 
The ambience is great - the music is great, the crowd is the usual hip-20 somethings and it's great for a date night or to come with your girl friends! 
PSA it's BYOB and there's a lot of parking outside if you're bringing a car. 
My only negative comment: 
when we'd called they said "if you will leave by 9:30, then we do have a reservation at 7:30 that's available" hmmm...bad impression. i get they get busy but that's just bad customer service. doesn't make me not wanna come back though!

Yuzu Sushi is somewhere I try to go every time I am in Chicago, meaning I make a reservation at least a week in advanced because it is always so busy!

 It is BYOB so we make sure to bring a bottle along or go to happy hour at some of the bars around the neighborhood before - my favorite is homestead on the roof because the food there is eh but the drinks are excellent.

The place is small but intimate. The waiters are friendly and super knowledgeable. They are great at making recommendations based on hunger level and what not. Also, the artwork of sauces is designed by each staff member, giving the experience a more personal feel. Also they have the cutest mugs, which you can also order on their website!

To start my friends and I shared the spicy edamame, asparagus bacon, and the bacon scallops - can you tell we love bacon? The bacon was a little chewy but so flavorful and greasy; so if you're trying to watch your diet, we can't be friends.

For our main course we had the Boy Meets World and the Over the Rainbow Roll. If you came for the artwork, these rolls will not disappoint. The sauce is fantastic and the fish and veggies were so fresh and tasteful. I could go back again tonight and eat it all over again. The sauce adds the extra flavor but doesn't overpower the fish. I cannot tell you home much I love it here.

Yuzu is one of the most well rounded sushi spots in Chicago. Venue is fun and hip, sushi is solid, and the prices are reasonable. On a double date, we went to Yuzu to satisfy our dinner time craving for sushi and ended up doing exactly that. 

We started off with appetizers which included the gyoza chicken dumplings, bang bang shrimp, and miso soup. Each was a great starter in its own right. We then moved on to the various sushi orders: shrimp tempura, boy meets world, spicy tuna, and breaking bad. All the rolls were good and I can't say that I had an inclination for one over the others. 

We ended up full with no room for dessert - on a side note, my wife and I were here only a week earlier for the mochi ice cream class so we were "mochied" out. 

I look forward to future visits as Yuzu will continue to be a top 3 spot for me when great sushi is the target.

Ahhhh I finally got to try this place! And it lived up to the hype. My friends and I spontaneously decided to grab dinner here- more like I insisted since we were in the area- on this particular Sunday night. We arrived right before dinner opening time with some Sapporo's from the liquor store across the street (which has a great beer selection by the way...). Luckily, even without a reservation, we were able to get a table for 4 as long as we were out by 6:30. Easy.

No corkage fee was a plus, and the quick service was another. Though the prices of the rolls are pretty high, the amount of food you get within one roll is well worth it. I was STUFFED after one roll. I had a seaweed salad to go along with my Born to Chill roll, and both were excellent. Obviously you kinda go here for the really snazzy presentation, and that's exactly what I got. The decorative sauces were great, and this was probably one of the prettiest rolls I've had. Still a substantial amount of fresh fish too.

Overall, I would go again. Hands down. Who doesn't love BYOB sushi???

Great sushi spot in Chicago, Me and my Bf tried the 
Dragon ball roll , Chicago spring and the mango avocado salad. Rolls were really tasty, my favorite was the dragon ball roll. liked the sushi but did not Love it. The presentation was absolutely amazing, I have never seen  anything like it. I was blown away by the presentation. The mango avocado salad was super tasty but it was too spicy for my taste. 

 only CONS
 they lack on service, Am not too picky with service as long as I get my food within a reasonable timing but I can say I never got a refill on my drink and we got about 3 different severs our time being there. I also think there restaurant could be better organized, if you get lucky and get a good table you can eat comfortably but if you come when its packed you literally have to eat right next to strangers which am not fond of. 

overall Yuzu stands out because of its splendid presentation / if you are in the Chicago area this a must try but be warned of seating and service lol.

I've been to Yuzu a few times and have found it to be A-OK! I know everyone loves here because of the art they draw with the sauces for the sushis. Agreed, totally cool. But their maki combinations, food, ambiance, everything to me screams average. Don't get me wrong, I find Yuzu to be completely acceptable and a fun experience to get some cool Insta-photos, but if you're looking for the best sashimi or makis in the city, you may be a bit disappointed.

Yuzu has a crazy reservation process. I've gone weeknights with just one friend and haven't had much of an issue getting a table without a reservation. However on weekends, definitely make a reso. If you're with a group, def make a reservation. If you're taking a date, most definitely make a reservation so you don't look like a schlub and have to wait.

So if you do make a reservation, you get some texts confirming their intense restrictions. Then on the day of my 6pm reservation, at 5:50 I received a text that my table will be ready in 10 minutes and to check in within 10 minutes or it would be released. So...you apparently can't arrive even 1 minute past your reservation. Alright Alinea, relax. 

Every time I've been here the music has been so loud that my friends and I yell at each, then are exhausted by the end of dinner. This is in 'In' place for some people but I'm just too old for that ish. Service is sometimes really friendly & fabulous, other times rushed & bare bones.

Pro-Tip: BYOB for them is Wine & Beer only! If you have a friend who drinks hard anything (we brought whiskey for a couple of the people), that's a no go. 

And then, the important stuff. The food! I find their maki rolls to be just okay. And holy rice explosion, Yuzu uses a lot of rice in their makis. Their non-sushi food I've had has been great, though.
+Sweet Potato Roll $7 - Tempura-ed sweet potato in a pretty basic roll. This is one of my go to rolls. Liked it, didn't love it. 
+Boston Roll $10 - A lot of rice and a ton of tempura crumbs on the outside. Though some may love that, I didn't care for it. This roll was filled with tuna, avocado, chili sauce, masago & mayo. Sounded like a tasty roll and it was okay, but nothing I'd get again.
+Motown Effect $16 - smoked salmon, unagi, kani kama, cream cheese, avocado, jalapeno, spicy mayo, sweet soy sauce, scallion and topped with red tobiko then lightly battered in tempura. This roll was a beast! I really don't know if you could possibly throw more ingredients in a roll! Even with all that, liked it, wasn't in love with it and would try a different roll next time.
+Tator Tots $8 - Best thing I've had at Yuzu! They have some togarashi, truffle and garlic aioli and come in a good sized portion. They honestly could use just a bit more of the aioli to ensure there is enough for all the tots but overall a good dish.

I've been to Yuzu a few times now to get their awesome sushi sauce art. You have to order their jumbo rolls and I've now tried 4 different ones and never got some cool peacock or tiger like I've seen on Instagram. I always get this swooshy kind of brown rainbow. It does look cool, absolutely, but just know if you're going for the art, it isn't always going to happen. I'm 0 for 3.

Yuzu is okay and I'm sure I'll go again because my social media friends always want to try their fancy rolls for their fancy art. I find the sushi to be average, service average, atmosphere kind of annoying, reservation process silly but understand it's a hot sushi spot for the city.

Pro tip: Make a reservation!

My sisters and I had planned a much needed girl's night out dinner. Since they're living the suburban life, I wanted to take them somewhere chill for sushi. Other BYOB sushi places that I've gone to are just okay. I wanted something special without breaking the bank. Yay for Yuzu!

We made reservations for an early dinner, 5pm, on a Saturday. When I called, the hostess told me that we could stay until 6:30pm. They have to clear the table after 90 minutes. Which is understandable. She wasn't rude about it. 

We get there promptly after buying wine across the street. It's amazing how quickly the restaurant fills up in an hour! So yes, make reservations!

For appetizers, we ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp (fried shrimp ball), the Good Brussel Sprout and the regular miso soup. All which were delicious!

We tried a couple of robata: the beef short ribs and the chicken golak. I'm trying to cut down on meat, but I wanted a plate full of both! The Chicken Golak's seasons were terrific!

In terms of rolls we went for the Dragon Ball, shrimp tempura and what's my name. They tasted quite fresh and the side sauce was really good. They're known for really artistic designs for their rolls, so it was neat to see as well!

All in all, I'm a huge fan of Robata, especially because it isn't expensive for the quality of food we had! 

I definitely plan to go back!

Easily my favorite sushi spot in Chicago or any city for that matter. Ambience and decor is very urban and trendy with manga art pieces on the wall. The food is amazing and artistic at the same time. Sushi sauces come as beautiful pieces of art. Fresh flavorful sushi and the Short rib skewers are unreal. Prices are pretty reasonable and it's byob so you can't go wrong. One of my favorite all around restaurants.

Went for an early Sunday night dinner. Had to make a reservation for our group of 8, no issues at all with being seated. It's a small, cozy space with the feel of an underground sushi bar. BYOB is great.

Started off with the beef short rib and shishito peppers from the grill. Tasty and enjoyable. Our table mates also ordered the pok which was very fresh. We tried several rolls which were quite unique. Presentation was also on point. We will be back!

To start my friends and I shared the spicy edamame, asparagus bacon, and the bacon scallops - can you tell we love bacon? The bacon was a little chewy but so flavorful and greasy; so if you're trying to watch your diet, we can't be friends.

For our main course we had the Boy Meets World and the Over the Rainbow Roll. If you came for the artwork, these rolls will not disappoint. The sauce is fantastic and the fish and veggies were so fresh and tasteful. I could go back again tonight and eat it all over again. The sauce adds the extra flavor but doesn't overpower the fish. I cannot tell you home much I love it here.

Yuzu is one of the most well rounded sushi spots in Chicago. Venue is fun and hip, sushi is solid, and the prices are reasonable. On a double date, we went to Yuzu to satisfy our dinner time craving for sushi and ended up doing exactly that. 

We started off with appetizers which included the gyoza chicken dumplings, bang bang shrimp, and miso soup. Each was a great starter in its own right. We then moved on to the various sushi orders: shrimp tempura, boy meets world, spicy tuna, and breaking bad. All the rolls were good and I can't say that I had an inclination for one over the others. 

We ended up full with no room for dessert - on a side note, my wife and I were here only a week earlier for the mochi ice cream class so we were "mochied" out. 

I look forward to future visits as Yuzu will continue to be a top 3 spot for me when great sushi is the target.

Ahhhh I finally got to try this place! And it lived up to the hype. My friends and I spontaneously decided to grab dinner here- more like I insisted since we were in the area- on this particular Sunday night. We arrived right before dinner opening time with some Sapporo's from the liquor store across the street (which has a great beer selection by the way...). Luckily, even without a reservation, we were able to get a table for 4 as long as we were out by 6:30. Easy.

No corkage fee was a plus, and the quick service was another. Though the prices of the rolls are pretty high, the amount of food you get within one roll is well worth it. I was STUFFED after one roll. I had a seaweed salad to go along with my Born to Chill roll, and both were excellent. Obviously you kinda go here for the really snazzy presentation, and that's exactly what I got. The decorative sauces were great, and this was probably one of the prettiest rolls I've had. Still a substantial amount of fresh fish too.

Overall, I would go again. Hands down. Who doesn't love BYOB sushi???

Great sushi spot in Chicago, Me and my Bf tried the 
Dragon ball roll , Chicago spring and the mango avocado salad. Rolls were really tasty, my favorite was the dragon ball roll. liked the sushi but did not Love it. The presentation was absolutely amazing, I have never seen  anything like it. I was blown away by the presentation. The mango avocado salad was super tasty but it was too spicy for my taste. 

 only CONS
 they lack on service, Am not too picky with service as long as I get my food within a reasonable timing but I can say I never got a refill on my drink and we got about 3 different severs our time being there. I also think there restaurant could be better organized, if you get lucky and get a good table you can eat comfortably but if you come when its packed you literally have to eat right next to strangers which am not fond of. 

overall Yuzu stands out because of its splendid presentation / if you are in the Chicago area this a must try but be warned of seating and service lol.

I've been to Yuzu a few times and have found it to be A-OK! I know everyone loves here because of the art they draw with the sauces for the sushis. Agreed, totally cool. But their maki combinations, food, ambiance, everything to me screams average. Don't get me wrong, I find Yuzu to be completely acceptable and a fun experience to get some cool Insta-photos, but if you're looking for the best sashimi or makis in the city, you may be a bit disappointed.

Yuzu has a crazy reservation process. I've gone weeknights with just one friend and haven't had much of an issue getting a table without a reservation. However on weekends, definitely make a reso. If you're with a group, def make a reservation. If you're taking a date, most definitely make a reservation so you don't look like a schlub and have to wait.

So if you do make a reservation, you get some texts confirming their intense restrictions. Then on the day of my 6pm reservation, at 5:50 I received a text that my table will be ready in 10 minutes and to check in within 10 minutes or it would be released. So...you apparently can't arrive even 1 minute past your reservation. Alright Alinea, relax. 

Every time I've been here the music has been so loud that my friends and I yell at each, then are exhausted by the end of dinner. This is in 'In' place for some people but I'm just too old for that ish. Service is sometimes really friendly & fabulous, other times rushed & bare bones.

Pro-Tip: BYOB for them is Wine & Beer only! If you have a friend who drinks hard anything (we brought whiskey for a couple of the people), that's a no go. 

And then, the important stuff. The food! I find their maki rolls to be just okay. And holy rice explosion, Yuzu uses a lot of rice in their makis. Their non-sushi food I've had has been great, though.
+Sweet Potato Roll $7 - Tempura-ed sweet potato in a pretty basic roll. This is one of my go to rolls. Liked it, didn't love it. 
+Boston Roll $10 - A lot of rice and a ton of tempura crumbs on the outside. Though some may love that, I didn't care for it. This roll was filled with tuna, avocado, chili sauce, masago & mayo. Sounded like a tasty roll and it was okay, but nothing I'd get again.
+Motown Effect $16 - smoked salmon, unagi, kani kama, cream cheese, avocado, jalapeno, spicy mayo, sweet soy sauce, scallion and topped with red tobiko then lightly battered in tempura. This roll was a beast! I really don't know if you could possibly throw more ingredients in a roll! Even with all that, liked it, wasn't in love with it and would try a different roll next time.
+Tator Tots $8 - Best thing I've had at Yuzu! They have some togarashi, truffle and garlic aioli and come in a good sized portion. They honestly could use just a bit more of the aioli to ensure there is enough for all the tots but overall a good dish.

I've been to Yuzu a few times now to get their awesome sushi sauce art. You have to order their jumbo rolls and I've now tried 4 different ones and never got some cool peacock or tiger like I've seen on Instagram. I always get this swooshy kind of brown rainbow. It does look cool, absolutely, but just know if you're going for the art, it isn't always going to happen. I'm 0 for 3.

Yuzu is okay and I'm sure I'll go again because my social media friends always want to try their fancy rolls for their fancy art. I find the sushi to be average, service average, atmosphere kind of annoying, reservation process silly but understand it's a hot sushi spot for the city.

Pro tip: Make a reservation!

My sisters and I had planned a much needed girl's night out dinner. Since they're living the suburban life, I wanted to take them somewhere chill for sushi. Other BYOB sushi places that I've gone to are just okay. I wanted something special without breaking the bank. Yay for Yuzu!

We made reservations for an early dinner, 5pm, on a Saturday. When I called, the hostess told me that we could stay until 6:30pm. They have to clear the table after 90 minutes. Which is understandable. She wasn't rude about it. 

We get there promptly after buying wine across the street. It's amazing how quickly the restaurant fills up in an hour! So yes, make reservations!

For appetizers, we ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp (fried shrimp ball), the Good Brussel Sprout and the regular miso soup. All which were delicious!

We tried a couple of robata: the beef short ribs and the chicken golak. I'm trying to cut down on meat, but I wanted a plate full of both! The Chicken Golak's seasons were terrific!

In terms of rolls we went for the Dragon Ball, shrimp tempura and what's my name. They tasted quite fresh and the side sauce was really good. They're known for really artistic designs for their rolls, so it was neat to see as well!

All in all, I'm a huge fan of Robata, especially because it isn't expensive for the quality of food we had! 

I definitely plan to go back!

Easily my favorite sushi spot in Chicago or any city for that matter. Ambience and decor is very urban and trendy with manga art pieces on the wall. The food is amazing and artistic at the same time. Sushi sauces come as beautiful pieces of art. Fresh flavorful sushi and the Short rib skewers are unreal. Prices are pretty reasonable and it's byob so you can't go wrong. One of my favorite all around restaurants.

Went for an early Sunday night dinner. Had to make a reservation for our group of 8, no issues at all with being seated. It's a small, cozy space with the feel of an underground sushi bar. BYOB is great.

Started off with the beef short rib and shishito peppers from the grill. Tasty and enjoyable. Our table mates also ordered the pok which was very fresh. We tried several rolls which were quite unique. Presentation was also on point. We will be back!

We went on a Saturday night around 6pm, and it was already getting busy. We sat on the patio but I regretted my decision shortly after due to the blazing sun. But the cold beck's kept me happy. The service was prompt as she took our appetizer order. The Tuna Poke was absolutely delicious! The pork shoulder was pretty good as well. We got the alaska roll and motown jumbo roll, and they were both fresh and delicious! Obviously loved the arts with the sauces, and they all went well with the sushi.
 I'm used to cheap sushi (quantity over quality..oh yes!) and the freshness of yuzu's rolls were a welcome change. 
We enjoyed our meal and will certainly be back for more! I'll take people's advice here and make a reservation next time, so we can enjoy our meal inside :)

So, I've been in Chicago for a few months now...and this is my first sushi spot in the city. I mean, I've had some delivery, but those options aren't always the greatest and they are usually the options I'm left with when it's later in the even and all the normal places have closed. Also, most of the time it's raining and I just don't want to go outside.

My friend invited me to check this place out. Walking in, I didn't have any expectations. I didn't even look up their Yelp rating. I was just going with it...and DUDE! It totally panned out. This place is good and we even got to try some of their new menu items. 

We were able to snag a table by the window, which was nice. The place isn't huge, but it was a nice size. They had booths along the walls and tables also. The service is good. It's a cute spot, but really that wasn't my focus.

First glance at the menu and I'm already excited. They don't just have sushi, they have izakaya (think Japanese tapas aka small plates) and robata (Japanese kabobs aka grilled skewers). There were actually other things, but most of my focus was on the sushi (super fresh fish), izakaya and robata.

Highlights:
Shaved Brussel Sprouts salad - OMG, so good and citrusy and refreshing
Naturto on Fleek - their rolls are insanely pretty and delicious
Summer Breeze & Ocean - delicious, must like ika (aka calamari)
Holy Hotategai - I like scallop, so this was already a winner in my book...it just really helped that it was super fresh
Tuna Truffle - really good cute of tuna, great color, great flavor
Karaage - they definitely don't make it like the usual, it's delicious and the dipping sauce is also different and delicious, sweet chili yum
moffle truffle - mochi waffle, different texture than your usual waffle (on the fence about the texture (more chewy), but the flavors were great and super delicious

Lowlights:
Bang bang shrimp - it's actually fine, but unlike the bang bang shrimp I've had in other places, it's not simply tempura battered shrimp, but more like a shrimp meatball...which is different. good flavor, comes with chantrelles and arugula, but the texture...eh
Whimsical spring roll - really just tasted like a dry salad wrapped up. you have to really drench in sauce, but honestly we didn't even finish this. It was super fresh produce, which was good and the crunch of the veggies were nice, but not a lot of flavor (which would be all in the sauce), but even then...eh.

TLDR: definitely should check this out. Their sushi art is out of this world!

I had this place bookmarked for years!! So I was so stoked to come here while visiting Chi-town. However, while the aesthetics were true to the pictures, the taste of the sushi (maybe it was just the roll we got?) fell short.

FOOD:
- Avocado mango salad +5/5
THIS was surprisingly our favorite dish of the night. The generous portions of both mango & avocado and the bomb dressing made this salad perfect.
- Tempera udon +4/5
This is your average udon with a VERY generous amount of tempura (squash, broccoli, shrimp, etc..)
- Breaking Bad Roll +3.5/5
We got this after looking at recs on yelp, but this fell short. There was just too much going on in the roll & the end product wasn't that great. 

SERVICE:
- is a hit & miss. We told one of the servers that we had come from LA just for the sushi art so she made sure to let the chefs know. On the other hand, another server was pretty rude & ignored our hand waving multiple times. 

TIPS:
- make reservations! The place gets packed.
- BYOB! They don't sell any alcohol so bring your own! This was one of the things we didn't know & everyone around us brought a variety of drinks. :) 

Overall, if you're a huge aesthetic fan like I am - definitely check out the place, but I'm not sure if I'd make the trek out here the next time I'm visiting chi-town.

Sushi is good, skewers are good! Definitely make a reservation to avoid a wait. AND bring your own bottles!!! 

The fish is fresh, and you can taste it. The bacon wrapped scallop skewer was really tasty and the scallop was so tender.

The only downside is the amount of sauce they give you! I know it's all part of the appeal and is "art" but it's so wasteful! Felt a little guilty not eating it all, but who wants that much sauce!

Great sushi place in the UV. The Robata plates are great, get the mushrooms, they're amazing. Also the tots are great! I've been here a few times with friends and have enjoyed several of the small plates and rolls. They also have classes on Mochi Ice Cream and Sushi Rolling if you are interested. They usually post them on their Facebook Page, so go follow them for the upcoming schedule. 

Oh yeah, one more thing, BYOB! So bring your sake, wine and beer (Limit on bottles per person) to enjoy with your meal. No Hard Liquor.

Yuzu is still really delicious coming here after over 2 years ago. My friends and I came ended up in the neighborhood on a trip to Forbidden Roots, which is right across the street! Our group ordered a variety of items. For an appetizer, we got the tater tots for the table, which was unexpected delicious with the aioli sauce covered on top. Other highlights were the sushi burrito and grilled pork shoulder. I also ordered the grilled chicken satay, which was okay as I was not a big fan of the  sauce splattered on the top. It may have been better if there was some rice as well. All sushi here is really good and come out with beautiful designs on the plate. 

The larger sushi plates are fairly expensive but they do come out with significantly more pieces than the smaller plates and have cooler designs. One large sushi plate is just enough for a meal for one person so it might be worthwhile to go with a group and order different sushi plates and share. Overall, it was a pleasant trip coming out here again after so many years.

I called the day before and placed a reservation. They were flexible with reservation, but just needed the table back after 1.5 hours. I was little worried initially that it might take longer than that to get our food and feel rushed, however that wasn't the case! The atmosphere is dark and trendy, which was really great. The place is pretty small, but intimate. 

It was pretty crowded when we got there, but we were seated right when we walked in. Yuzu is BYOB with no corkage fee so we brought a bottle of wine. We ordered two robata plates: beef short rib and chicken golek. Both were delicious and had a great sauce on them. For our sushi rolls, we got Sorry I'm drunk, dragon ball, and chicago spring. The jumbo rolls are the one with the grafitti-inspired drawings with the sauce. All of the rolls were delicious and tasted fresh.

Definitely would come back again!

I like this place, but 3 stars is really about what it deserves.   Based on observations from several visits:

The good: sushi rolls are interesting and the plates are decorated with "sushi art".  Fun vibe.  Extensive menu.  Sushi burritos at lunch are fun and flavorful.  BYO.

The not-so-good: service is indifferent, which included some dirty glassware at our table.  Non-sushi items can be hit-or-miss; the steak teriyaki bordered on bad.  Sushi art can be messy...in one notable case the artwork leaked all over our table.  

Worth going to, but understand the limitations going in and stick to the sushi.

I think I'm in love...it was my first visit but Yuzu had it all; originality, looks, and charisma.....

I had an amazing experience at Yuzu. This restaurant is doing everything right. The service was fantastic. I love the decor. It was minimalistic / industrial with really sweet wood panel anime art. And they're rockin' hip hop.

Let's talk about the food....everything was fresh and delicious.  There is such a diversity to the menu. My husband doesn't eat fish and Yuzu had delicious options. He ordered the Green Harbour which is one of their jumbo rolls. It was all veggie deliciousness. The crunch on the sweet potato, broccoli and grilled asparagus tempura was fantastic. The sweet soy was especially delicious as well. I had the Very Spicy Tuna which was simple but super fresh and good. We also ordered from the robata section of the menu: short rib and ribeye.  The ribeye was so delicious that we ordered a second! I also had the shrimp tempura roll. That was also delicious. 

The presentation was fantastic. I would call it edible street art. I'm in awe of its accessible beauty.

There are so many things that I want to try on this menu. I will be back endlessly! Oh, it's byob, fantastic! Go now! :) I'll see you there!

One of the better Japanese and sushi places in Chicago AND it's BYOB!

From izakaya, noodles, rices, sushi rols, maki and robata grill yummy treats, there's something delicious for everyone - unless you have one "those" friends. Any everything is perfect for sharing.

I recommend the following dishes:

Izakaya:
- Brussels spouts
- Baked mushrooms
- Tuna poke

Robata:
- Bacon scallop
- Beef short rib
- Pork shoulder
- Cauliflower
- Shishito
- Ribeye 

Sushi Rolls:
- Very spicy tuna
- !00 years of solitude (amazing book too!)
- Born to chill

Enjoy!

From izakaya, noodles, rices, sushi rols, maki and robata grill yummy treats, there's something delicious for everyone - unless you have one "those" friends. Any everything is perfect for sharing.

I recommend the following dishes:

Izakaya:
- Brussels spouts
- Baked mushrooms
- Tuna poke

Robata:
- Bacon scallop
- Beef short rib
- Pork shoulder
- Cauliflower
- Shishito
- Ribeye 

Sushi Rolls:
- Very spicy tuna
- !00 years of solitude (amazing book too!)
- Born to chill

Enjoy!

Really solid sushi place. It's a fun atmosphere, and BYOB. The rolls are large and the sushi art always is impressive I'm a fan of the sin nombre, boy meets world, and a bunch of others. Service is sometimes slow, but last time they were much better--so nice improvement there!! Also, helps to make a reservation.

A great place. The fish is top notch as is the service. Prices are a little higher than comparable restaurants, but it is BYOB, so you can end up saving money on that end! Recommend highly.

I'm not even gonna front. When it comes to sushi, I like it. I don't love it. I only have sushi when other people want it and I'm just like "aight whatever". But Yuzu got me on some Drake sh*t all " I love yo sushi roll, hotter den wasabi." 

I've never even been to any other reputable sushi places. I started from the bottom and now I'm here. That Drake reference was completely unintentional. Anyway. I cannot critique sushi because of how little sushi places I've been to and the fact I only eat it once, maybe twice a year. But if you love sushi, I think you'll like this place. And if I'm wrong, your dumbass shouldn't have listened to me. I told you I barely eat this stuff.

I pretty much just sit my ass down and let other people order and we all share. I don't really understand the point of edamame, but it's grown on me. It's good, but I can't see how it varies all that much from place to place. The Korean short ribs are the truth though. I can eat about a 100 skewers of those, no lie. 

I'm mesmerized by the sushi and all the color. They're like looking into a kaleidoscope or some sh*t. My two favorite rolls that I've had thus far are the Chicago Spring and the Picasso. I don't even remember what all was in them, but the latter contained a delicious spicy wasabi mayo that gave it a noticeable kick. I'm usually good about letting other people take the last piece unless they insist, but I was all "sorry fam, i'm taking this right here." The Chicago Spring had this great crispy texture on the outside that I was a big fan of. 

Pretty sure this was my first attempt reviewing a legit sushi place. I think I did aight. If you don't agree, I'll kill you (not really. But I might).

Good sushi with great presentation, I really liked their spicy miso soup. The sushi is very fresh, but the seaweed was a bit to thick.

This is my ultimate sushi spot. It is my favorite by far and there are a lot of great places in Chicago! They're plates look too good to eat but they are truly as delicious as they look! The poke is my favorite thing in the world because it comes with a beautiful fan of avocado. If you're an avocado lover like me, you'll die and go to heaven with this dish!

There are just so many reasons why I love this place. Its got amazing sushi, amazing Robata Grill, and its BYOB! 

The place is pretty small and narrow, so if you have a large group like we did plan accordingly. The vibe and atmosphere is dark romantic/exclusive which really sets the tone. Food comes out pretty quick which was awesome. We stuck to small plates, n rolls which is norm for us. Some faves:

SP/Robata: Bang Bang Sprimp, Tuna Poke, Ribeye, Shortrib 
Rolls: Breaking Bad, Born to Chill, Motown Effect 

Everything here tastes great! But what really stood out to me was the rolls came out with the sauce that was made into art on the plate. Never seen that before, that was pretty cool. For those reasons and more this spot has became my fav spot for sushi, but overall one of my favorites of Chicago!!

This place is my favorite! Where you find a spot that has great rolls and fresh sashimi you've won the sushi lottery! 

My only issue is the 1.5 hour max seating time. That's a bit annoying.

The food was amazing!! One one star rating goes to service. I have never been told by a restaurant to leave. My friend and I came for dinner and our waiter and the hostess both approached our table and told us that we had to leave because they had other reservations for the evening. I would not go back to this restaurant again due to the rudeness of the staff.

2015 fan here....not so much 2017.

Yuzu was great in the past whether dining in or speedy deliver service--this place did not disappoint. What's not to love? Artful presentation, quality sushi rolls, fast service. The train doesn't just stop there, but this is how I would describe Yuzu in the past.

This year I have gone back for several occasions, and I have found their sushi to be consistently lacking.  At first I couldn't pin point on what had changed. For me, I like my sushi in manageable bite sizes--the kind that doesn't fall apart when you pick it up with chopsticks. The rolls at Yuzu have gotten so big and not as tightly rolled, so it has been a messy eating experience.  Making sushi is such an art.  In Japan, people literally spend 10 years perfecting their sushi making skills, and it is starting to feel like Yuzu is compromising on the skills part for quantity which isn't always a good thing.  Trust me, I love rice, but I don't want to bite into a hunk of rice. I think it's rare that sushi places ever get the right ratio between rice and filling, and all I know is that Yuzu is going down a slippery slope.

Sushi is said to be an aphrodisiac...

I don't know where I was going with that, but holy hell I am in love - with the butterflies and everything. 

While it started off rocky with the hostess telling me that I would need to be finished eating and gone by 7pm because of a reservation (tsk tsk, sure I'll sacrifice and ruin my dinner experience for the sake of some stranger?? Umm, no? You're the business, you're supposed to figure out the management), it ended rather pleasant. 

I am a huge "aesthetics" person, and I loved the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant. The walls had a Dragon Ball Z theme and the ashy wooden tables harmoniously complimented the darker anterior of the dimly lit room. It has a community-cafeteria set-up where there is one long bench against the wall and multiple tables placed alongside it. There are 4-person tables next to the sushi bar as well. Because the restaurant is a bit small, you have to get a little cozy with your neighbors - so conversation is not always private. Personally, I do not prefer this. I like not having to squeeze in between people to get to my seat. And more arm room is never bad room. Note: I recommend making a reservation because tables fill up quick. 

I ordered the Dragon Ball and Riverwalk Rolls. Oh, man. It was hands down one of the best sushi rolls I have ever laid my eyes on and, well... put in my mouth. The Dragon Ball contains shrimp tempura and unagi, etc. The Riverwalk contained super tuna and cilantro, etc. Have you ever eaten sushi and everything just tasted the same - i.e. sushi buffets. Yuzu sushi is amazing - all flavors were so distinct. I could taste all the different flavors and meats. I can definitely taste the thought that was put into each roll. Everything compliments each other. Not to mention, the chefs drew beautiful, colorful designs with their dipping sauce onto the plate (I think unagi or shrimp sauce??). The sauces do not overpower the sushi roll when eaten together. Note: I ordered a side of chili powder and mixed it with my soy sauce - DELICIOUSLY SPICY. 

Service was perfect for the most part - very friendly and attentive. 

Bathrooms made me giggle. There is a container of mouthwash for everyone to use... Remember when I said sushi was an aphrodisiac? Wink wink. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the sushi! I only rated it a 4 because of the earlier service and the congestion of a section I was in.

This is a review for the Mochi Ice Cream making class held at Yuzu. I haven't been able to try the sushi here yet, but it's next on my list! 

I LOVE mochi ice cream so when I found out there was a mochi ice cream class, I immediately bought tickets (around $95 for 2 people). The class was small as there was only around 16 people. The steps are easy to follow and there are 2 assistants walking around to help. You make as many mochi wraps as you can and you get 8 scoops of Jeni's ice cream as the mochi ice cream filling. While the final products do not taste as good as the mochi ice cream you find in grocery stores, it's an absolute blast to make!

Came into Yuzu Sushi & Robata Grill on a Thursday (10/13) evening with my boyfriend and 3 other friends. Upon arriving (with no reservation) we waited a few minutes before being greeted by the host, it was pretty busy! We put in our name for a table of 5 and waited about 10 minutes (could've been less than that). We were excited about sushi and it being my boyfriend's and my first time here I was ready for a great evening and so ready to chow down!

We were seated right in front of the Sushi chefs and I loved the view, seeing the chef's at work added to excitement of the night! The surrounding space by the Sushi Chefs was one of the areas where we had good lighting, the atmosphere is dark and intimate. The place was so a live with conversation, with laughter, every table I gazed at looked like they were enjoying themselves! The great atmosphere definitely set the mood, I knew we were in for an amazing night!

When our server came over she was so sweet and kind! You can't fake the service she put out, she added to the enjoyment of our night! With 4 hungry men at the table and 1 gorgeous woman, we all have different tastes and to say the least our table was expecting a significant amount food! Our server handled our orders well, with 5 different picky requests and needs, everyone ordered knowing exactly what to expect.

I should mention that I am a Strict Vegetarian and it was great to see I had so many choices to choose from. It's great knowing that my food restrictions did not get in the way of the evening! I got exactly what I wanted, the Asparagus Roll (Tempura, special request), Sweet Potato Tempura Roll, and a double order of the Robata Tofu! They've got a great menu with so many choices, they have something for everyone! And if you need to tweak something, don't hesitate to ask, Yuzu is very accommodating!!! 

Everyone at the table was pretty amazed at the rate our orders were being brought out. We didn't wait long and I was expecting and prepared (because it was busy) to wait a while. Another great plus about Yuzu is the BYOB factor, while we waited for our food we were enjoying our ice cold beers!  Everything was great! We enjoyed the cool atmosphere (great music play list that night), the food was delicious, and the service was impeccable! 

I totally recommend Yuzu Sushi & Robata Grill for a night out! Great place for an intimate date with your loved one and a perfect place to meet with a group of friends (they've got the space for it)! The food is so intricately prepared, the presentation is almost too pretty to mess up by digging in, and more importantly everything is delicious! They have definitely gained another client, I loved my experience and totally intend to come back for more! Thank You!!

This is a fun restaurant. The noise level is a bit loud so don't plan for a intimate conversation. It BYOB and there is a store across the street that sells wine. Street/metered parking is available out front. The sushi and appetizers we had were delicious. The bigger rolls come out looking like a piece of art which is cool! I will definitely be back.

Just another Friday night, just another sushi bar, right? Wrong! Yuzu brings phenomenal cuisine together with a great contemporary atmosphere. My constant dinner companion "N" and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Yuzu, this time accompanied by Molly & Trent. Since Yuzu is BYO we brought a bottle of mid-range Pinot Grigio with us (no corkage fee, yay!), and perused the menu. So much good stuff, we started the appetizer round with gyoza, avocado and mango salad, and a robata sampler (I liked the beef best, go figure). Everything was very flavorful, although I think the gyoza was my favorite. 

Then for mains we had two rolls... a river walk and sin nombre, both excellent. I also ordered two pieces of their super white sashimi, my personal favorite. The river walk was like a double dose of fish, while the sin nombre was at least 50% avocado, taken together they were an interesting contrast. The super white was excellent, one of the best I've ever had.

So what was the venue like Bob? Hey, I'm glad you asked. Kinda typical 30-foot wide 100 foot deep, with a sushi bar dominating the room from 20 foot in. Brick walls, lots of anime set in triptyches on the long wall, contemporary tunes blasting out, pretty much an omnipresent wash of conversation punctuated by loud bursts of laughter. We did not have to yell to be heard, but it was not quiet by any stretch of the imagination.

I live in Ukranian village so there's really nothing much around except for the usual fast food joints and Ukranian spots, with some hidden gems here and there so when these guys opened up it was a real nice touch to the neighborhood. The food here isn't the best but it's definitely worth it. I've been coming here a lot over the past couple of months and I can tell you that everything on the menu is satisfying. While not every dish here is worth the price it's still a decent establishment to eat at so long as you stick to the sushi and smaller dishes. The poke bowl here is also surprisingly amazing.

I went here with a friend during my mid west trip. I saw this sushi place on Facebook awhile back and booked marked this place. I saw they have sushi arts that come with your sushi. This place is located in the West Town of Chicago. There is no private parking so you would need to park in the street and walk to the restaurant. When we got there, there is no line at all and got seated right away. We got seated in the bar area. This place lighting is kind of dark here but I guess it for the ambience of the place.This restaurant isn't too big but it cozy. I like their decorations here, it was very cute and creative. The waiter took our order after a few minutes of looking at the menu and drinking our drink. We ordered beef yakitori, tater tots, and dragon rolls. The menu have lots of food that I wanted to try but we already ordered a good amount already. Our food came out pretty fast. All the food that we ordered turned really good. I liked the most is dragon rolls and love the sushi arts next to it. The services is excellent and they checked up on us often. I would be back again if I'm Chicago again to try other food.

I have been wanting to try this place because of their way of presenting their food. It is the best place in town for sushi. I absolutely loved it. You can find free street parking

Just another Friday night, just another sushi bar, right? Wrong! Yuzu brings phenomenal cuisine together with a great contemporary atmosphere. My constant dinner companion "N" and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Yuzu, this time accompanied by Molly & Trent. Since Yuzu is BYO we brought a bottle of mid-range Pinot Grigio with us (no corkage fee, yay!), and perused the menu. So much good stuff, we started the appetizer round with gyoza, avocado and mango salad, and a robata sampler (I liked the beef best, go figure). Everything was very flavorful, although I think the gyoza was my favorite. 

Then for mains we had two rolls... a river walk and sin nombre, both excellent. I also ordered two pieces of their super white sashimi, my personal favorite. The river walk was like a double dose of fish, while the sin nombre was at least 50% avocado, taken together they were an interesting contrast. The super white was excellent, one of the best I've ever had.

So what was the venue like Bob? Hey, I'm glad you asked. Kinda typical 30-foot wide 100 foot deep, with a sushi bar dominating the room from 20 foot in. Brick walls, lots of anime set in triptyches on the long wall, contemporary tunes blasting out, pretty much an omnipresent wash of conversation punctuated by loud bursts of laughter. We did not have to yell to be heard, but it was not quiet by any stretch of the imagination.

I live in Ukranian village so there's really nothing much around except for the usual fast food joints and Ukranian spots, with some hidden gems here and there so when these guys opened up it was a real nice touch to the neighborhood. The food here isn't the best but it's definitely worth it. I've been coming here a lot over the past couple of months and I can tell you that everything on the menu is satisfying. While not every dish here is worth the price it's still a decent establishment to eat at so long as you stick to the sushi and smaller dishes. The poke bowl here is also surprisingly amazing.

I went here with a friend during my mid west trip. I saw this sushi place on Facebook awhile back and booked marked this place. I saw they have sushi arts that come with your sushi. This place is located in the West Town of Chicago. There is no private parking so you would need to park in the street and walk to the restaurant. When we got there, there is no line at all and got seated right away. We got seated in the bar area. This place lighting is kind of dark here but I guess it for the ambience of the place.This restaurant isn't too big but it cozy. I like their decorations here, it was very cute and creative. The waiter took our order after a few minutes of looking at the menu and drinking our drink. We ordered beef yakitori, tater tots, and dragon rolls. The menu have lots of food that I wanted to try but we already ordered a good amount already. Our food came out pretty fast. All the food that we ordered turned really good. I liked the most is dragon rolls and love the sushi arts next to it. The services is excellent and they checked up on us often. I would be back again if I'm Chicago again to try other food.

Yuzu's selection of rolls were very good, with names that were quirky. What made the rolls was the presentation. They took their time making some of these elaborate designs with unagi, sirrachi, and spicy mustard sauce to say the least. I appreciated the attention given by the wait staff, even on a busy Saturday. As soon as we were done, a plate was immediately removed, and my cup of water was never empty for more than a couple of minutes. I would say that this place is great, but the fact that I needed to almost yell because of the loud music kind of soured my true enjoyment of the place. But it won't stop me from coming back. Ask for the Motown... Best roll I've had there.

Excellent sushi! This was not on our list for Chicago but was recommended by a friend. Was really the highlight of our trip! Amazing menu selections. I don't think I could have ordered the wrong thing, if I tried. Definitely recommend a reservation or getting their early to beat the lines.

This place is my all time favorite places to go for sushi! And what's better? BYOB! No corkage fee, either. The sushi is on point and the presentation is amazing! Doesn't get any better than that! The place is really small and cramped though. Can't have a private conversation without the table next to you hearing. Literally feels like your eating with the table next to you, too. But who cares when the sushi is outstanding!

I was not too impressed. I thought the art was neat with their jumbo sushi but nothing more. It seemed like a lot of their sushi had either tuna or mango. The particular day I went, their tuna tasted mushy making the roll fall apart easily. As for their lunch specials, most of their box options included spicy tuna; it was sad that no other sushi was offered because their tuna isn't good. Overall, this place is not terrible but expensive, nor is it impressively tasty but average. And also, I think this place is more concerned about the size of the sushi than the quality. I couldn't really enjoy the taste because I was too busy not trying to choke.

Went by last night for dinner. Made a reservation for four at 6:30pm and the host asked of we would leave by eight o'clock...
Well yeah, but we shouldn't feel like there is a time limit. That was kind of strange.
Even if we ordered more food we would have only been there about an hour. They made the food pretty fast!

They style of the restaurant was perfect on the inside, but not very convenient. I had to squeeze my ass past the other table, because there was only about a 5 inch clearance between the tables (awkward). 
I personally like the rusty storefront sign outside, but I could see how it would make people rethink going in.

The food was obviously beautiful,  but it also tasted delicious. Might have been the best sushi I've had yet. But I am not a sushi connoisseur. We started with edamame which had a nice salt on the outside. Then, our table ordered 2 dragon rolls and two coconut and crunch rolls. I honestly liked both a lot. The dragon roll had a stronger veggie flavor which made it light and refreshing, but had a little kick of heat. The coconut and crunch rolls had the most crispy crunch eel inside with a delicious, smokey sauce on the plate. 
For dessert we ordered the mochi balls, which blew all of our minds. This isn't a big serving,  they suggest four but it would be better suited for two. They have the most interesting outer layer with a really good flavor ice cream on the inside.

The other food at other tables smelled/looked good too. Their menu doesnt seem to be available anywhere, but our bill split two ways was about $45 with no drinks. 
Sushi was about 10-18 dollars a roll. And had less than 8 pieces each.

In need of a sushi-fix I found this restaurant with the best reviews closest to my location. 
Since it was just myself it was easy to find a seat, but I was told I only had 30 min to eat since there was another party coming in to take the table. I order miso soup and a roll with shrimp tempura (I forgot the name, something with Chicago). It took longer to get my food than eat it. 

The rolls are okay. As everyone said their display is fabulous, but the taste was just okay. I only ate half the roll and saved the rest for later. The miso soup was great! But $3 for miso and I had like 10 minutes to gulf everything down before I was kicked off my table, so I felt a bit pressured. But overall it was good.

Yuzu is Presentation! 

The biggest problem with this restaurant has to be the service. They are very unorganized and it is sometimes very difficult to get a reservation here or even seated. They are very slow and take quite a bit of time to bring out your food and still, I give them 4 stars.

The food on the other hand is quite delicious! I've only been here once but the one time I was here, the sushi options are plentiful and the presentation is amazing! You are paying for that presentation and to top it off, the flavor of the sushi is delightful!. 

I would visit again next time I am in the area!

Visited this place because of the neat artwork done on each of the Jumbo rolls.  Some of the ones on yelp looked much better than the ones we got, but still looked different that what we would expect to see from California!  We did also go at lunchtime, and perhaps dinner time would be better.  

Fish used in the sushi was exceptionally mediocre - at times mushy.  Salmon seemed like it was defrosted a few days ago and had been sitting.  Not a place to go if you want great sushi IMO, but the presentation could get you a few more likes on IG.

Fun vibe, BYOB, takes reservations. I came here because I saw a viral video on Facebook about Yuzu's cool designs and sushi art that they do with their sauces. I'd say that the ones we got weren't as cool as the dragon I saw them do on the video - we got a cute fish instead. But I guess the art isn't the point, so on to the good. 

We got these AMAZING Brussels sprouts - I loved those and would totally eat again. Tried three rolls from the jumbo menu and all were pretty good! Jumbo rolls range from $15-18ish and are the ones that come with the sushi art. 

Make a reservation to be safe - I tried to make one same-day on a Wednesday for that evening and was told it was full until 8:30!

BYOB BYOB BYOB!!

My friend brought me here for dinner on a Friday night while I was visiting Chicago. This place is pretty neat and popular! We waited a good 45 minutes before getting a table. The good thing was the hostess would take your name and number so you can roam around the street of Chicago Ave before having dinner (or even go grab a bottle of wine because did I mention it's BYOB lol).

When we were seated (~8:00pm), the hostess did brought to our attention that we would have to be finished by 9:30pm because there is a reservation after us. We didn't really care too much because let's be real we aren't going to take an hour and a half to eat a couple rolls.

I think everyone around us brought their own wine (we also did too!). There is also NO CORKAGE FEE, which is ammmazzzinngggg. My friend and I ordered a few of items to share, we got the Gyoza, beef short rib (off of the Robata), Monster Spider roll and Over the Rainbow roll. 

Everything was really good. I think the specialty rolls were the best! They have really cool combinations. It seemed like everyone around us were also there for their rolls so definitely get the sushi rolls!

I think the total came out to be around $50 which wasn't too bad for what we ordered. The one thing I do have to comment (and is the reason why it lost a star) is that the restaurant is really loud and dark. I could barely see my food or even the menu! I also have to scream to talk to my friend. Aside from that it's a thumbs up for me!

We came across this sushi restaurant on whim. They were able to seat us quickly for a smaller place and we were a group of 5. Its a BYOB, which is a huge plus! We got a lot of sushi rolls to share as a table and all of them were delicious and for a great price. Will definitely go back with some bottles of wine.

I went here on a whim on a Friday night with my boyfriend a couple weeks ago, and we had a great experience. I had heard a lot of great things about this place, so I was eager to try it. If I'm being honest, PokemonGo had just made its debut a week before, so we were excited to venture outside of our neighborhood to catch Pokemon...

We arrived around 7pm, and the wait was 45 minutes. We decided to wait since they'd text us when our table was ready, and there were two Pokemon Lures outside where 10+ people were congregating... Anyway, I digress...

We received a text about 25 minutes later that a table had opened up on the patio. Score! For an appetizer, we shared the Robata Sampler 2, which included two beef short ribs, two chicken satay, and two pork shoulder. All of them were DELICIOUS, but my favorite was the beef short rib.

For dinner, my boyfriend got the chicken teriyaki (he doesn't like sushi), which was plentiful. I ordered the Boy Meets World roll, which was super delicious. Definitely more on the spicy side. Service was great, especially considering our server was manning a few tables on her own.

Kinda on the pricier side, but nothing outrageous for robata and sushi. I would highly recommend!

So this place is known for their crazy sauce art on their jumbo rolls, but that doesn't mean they're sacrificing flavor at all! We ordered: 
Smoke salmon roll- came with 6 pieces and was absolutely delicious. Just smoked salmon and rice wrapped in nori, but so much flavor. 
Motown roll- (jumbo) smoked salmon, unagi, cream cheese, jalapeo, avocado, and tempura battered. Really tasty! The tempura was super light and flaky, and all the flavors went nicely together- the heat from the jalapeo paired really well with the cream cheese and smoked salmon. So good!
Avocado and cucumber- like the smoked salmon, just the avocado and cucumber with rice inside the nori. Pretty good, but if you're going to go vegetarian, we recommend the jumbo rolls that pack more of a punch. 
Coconut and crab- (jumbo) soft shell crab, unagi, avocado, cream cheese, topped with coconut flakes. Never had this combo before but dang was it good! Coconut and sushi? Not a combo I would have thought of but I'm really glad Yuzu did. 
Green Harbor- (jumbo) vegetarian roll with avocado, tempura broccoli and sweet potato, and cucumber. The broccoli was a little strong and made it harder to taste everything in the roll, but still a really option for vegetarians. 
Service was good and the staff was really nice! Also helpful in explaining ingredients if you don't know what something is. 
We'd love to come back and try more!

Well, Yuzu is fun, a little different, and apparently (I am told) authentically Japanese! For $ 30, there's a lot of options, salad, sashimi, rolls and so on. The servers wasn't that kind. The combination of the size of portion, atmosphere and food quality was OK, not awesome! 

For those who are living close to them, I recommend going there, but for those who are leaving a not that close, I would say go to another restaurant! I mean, the restaurant is good but not so special as I had expected! 

They didn't even make something special in my plate!!! The server refuse to bring more water after I paid the bill! 

Overall it was not that bad, but I won't return! Besides, come on after paid the bill I don't have a right to ask for water! No make sense!

Loved this place! So many options and so colorful! This place makes sushi fun.

Rolls can be huge! I was with another person so we both got one roll each to share and if we wanted more we'd order after. We were stuffed! 

BYOB & don't be shy because every table did it. White wine as far as the eye could see. They bring you a chilling bucket and ice for your table too. 

Can't wait to come back. Ordered the Breaking Bad Roll and Midwestern Roll. I preferred the latter hands down. 

And that's all I have to say about that.

I do not know why it has taken me so long to write this review! Yuzu is my favorite sushi spot in Chicago!  The get 5 stars in taste and presentation. The rolls here are incredibly creative and always come out looking beautiful. If you are not in the mood for sushi, they have a plethora of other options. The robata is great (grilled meats on skewers). 

Reservations are strongly recommended as Yuzu is always busy.

Solid BYOB sushi joint that I'd recommend for early dinner dates or later evening friend gatherings. The first time I was here on a date we came at about 6ish on a Saturday. The place was maybe at 50% capacity. The sushi was good. The serving blocks were beautifully decorated. I actually preferred the Nigiri over the rolls. The Unagi rolls were very meh...not much unagi in them so I would recommend the nigari Unagi. 

I made a reservation here again for a second date (different girl) cause I enjoyed it the first time. This time we came at 8pm on a Friday night and the whole vibe was different. 115% capacity and hip hop music was BUMPIN! I loved the vibe but the girl I was with was very soft spoken so I was kind of kicking myself. 

The service was on point and the mochi flight was awesome! I would definitely go back depending on who I'm with.

I eat sushi and/or poke multiple times a week and Yuzu has the best of the best!  I like to branch out and order something new every time I go because their menu has a lot more than just sushi. 

Sushi Rolls: The jumbo rolls all come on a wooden board with an intricate sauce design, I think everyone should experience it at least once! The sushi is so beautiful that it made my Facebook profile picture. Not only does the sauce look exquisite, but its taste compliments the roll. It can be spicy, sweet, savory, or anything in between depending on what roll you order. As for the rolls themselves, if any of them are listed as spicy, you have the option to get a non-spicy version. My favorite jumbo roll is the Motown Effect because it's deep fried and has all my favorite ingredients: salmon, cream cheese, avocado, and spicy mayo (also comes with eel, kani kama, and a few other typical sushi fillings). It's a lot to stomach and really fills you up so I would only order if you're pretty hungry. My other go-to's are the River Walk and Picasso because they are loaded with fresh fish (I'm generally not a fan of shrimp, so each roll that I've mentioned doesn't contain shrimp).

My favorite non-sushi item is the udon noodle soup served with mixed tempura. I have gotten it to share with my boyfriend as a kind of appetizer/side dish. It comes with giant shrimp, carrot, zucchini, and broccoli tempura which have the perfect crunch but don't taste greasy or unhealthy like some other places. The soup has a lot of amazingly thick udon noodles that are a struggle to get on a spoon; but the taste is worth the challenge! I definitely recommend it as an add-on to the sushi. 

Dessert: One time my friend and I received a complimentary dessert (assorted mochi) because they forgot to serve her food without sesame, like she asked. Of course they quickly brought out new rolls but the free mochi was a great touch and the servers were genuinely sorry about the mistake. We had lychee and strawberry flavors and it was super refreshing after the giant meal. 

The atmosphere is lively but intimate. They have rap music playing but it's not overbearing, there's anime art on the walls that's really cool to look at, and the lighting is dim without obstructing visibility of anything. The tables are kind of close together, but I usually go with one other person and it's like you're in your own world of sushi together even though it's usually packed. The servers are polite and efficient- so efficient to the point where they clarify how long you will be dining there so that their reservations run smoothly and they avoid overbooking. I would definitely make a reservation if you want to go after 6 pm. 

They have street parking and it's not hard to find (you might have to walk a block or two). It's free on Sundays!

One more thing: it's BYOB; they don't serve alcohol. There is a liquor store across the street and they have restrictions on both amount and type (you can only bring beer wine or sake).

After reading all the great reviews regarding Yuzu, I visited the restaurant with high expectations. All the pictures of their sushi looked amazing. The menu offerings sound delicious and the 4-5 star reviews seemed to back all the excellent ratings. So I bookmarked Yuzu with the hopes that my experience would be the same. 

My husband and I had arrived 15 minutes late to our dinner reservation so I had Ben call them en route to let them know we were going to be behind. They were kind enough to hold our spot so that was much appreciated.

At 6:15, our party of two finally arrives. We get seated at a tiny table. (Unfortunately there's no booth seating here). I sat on their communal bench along the wall, Ben sat across from me in a stylish yet uncomfortable metal chair. On top of that, our table was wobbly. I didn't mind it too much but it was bothering the hell out of my husband. Our water cups begin to splash all over as he sets his arms off the sides of the table. This incident alone already sparked a not so great first impression. I had to use my linen napkin to sop the water from the table while the waiter stood by; clearly seeing all this was happening. He never bothered to step in and at least acknowledge the problem. Only after my husband requested a change in table, did they finally correct this issue.

Anyways, onto our meals. We ordered 2 sushi rolls. The Dopest (a signature roll), and their spicy scallop. I'm the type that likes to look at the menu way before arriving to the restaurant and at first, the Dopest sounded promising. It had spicy tuna, Chipolte ranch, sliced pears, and I'm sure I'm leaving out some essential ingredients here, but it was topped off with slices of scallop and foie gras. I never had foie gras before so I thought, "What the hell.... We're here, why not give it a try?" So we ordered it. As usual, my attempt at trying the complex and fancy bit me in the ass. There's just too much going on in this roll. Perhaps I don't have a complex or sophisticated enough palette, but the pears weren't necessary here. In addition
to this, I had a texture issue with the roll. Foie gras with scallops although great individually, didn't seem to blend well with this roll. First of all, its slimy and very fatty. I didn't like it. 

The spicy scallop roll and the premium steak teriyaki were enjoyable. These were worth ordering. 

There's mouthwash in the bathroom so if you want to freshen up after you had your meal, it's there for your convenience. Be careful not to confuse the mouthwash pump for soap. It's an easy rookie mistake.

Street parking only and the meters as of 12/2016 are $2.00/hour.

It's a decent place but I don't think it's worth a return visit.

BYOB BYOB BYOB!!

My friend brought me here for dinner on a Friday night while I was visiting Chicago. This place is pretty neat and popular! We waited a good 45 minutes before getting a table. The good thing was the hostess would take your name and number so you can roam around the street of Chicago Ave before having dinner (or even go grab a bottle of wine because did I mention it's BYOB lol).

When we were seated (~8:00pm), the hostess did brought to our attention that we would have to be finished by 9:30pm because there is a reservation after us. We didn't really care too much because let's be real we aren't going to take an hour and a half to eat a couple rolls.

I think everyone around us brought their own wine (we also did too!). There is also NO CORKAGE FEE, which is ammmazzzinngggg. My friend and I ordered a few of items to share, we got the Gyoza, beef short rib (off of the Robata), Monster Spider roll and Over the Rainbow roll. 

Everything was really good. I think the specialty rolls were the best! They have really cool combinations. It seemed like everyone around us were also there for their rolls so definitely get the sushi rolls!

I think the total came out to be around $50 which wasn't too bad for what we ordered. The one thing I do have to comment (and is the reason why it lost a star) is that the restaurant is really loud and dark. I could barely see my food or even the menu! I also have to scream to talk to my friend. Aside from that it's a thumbs up for me!

We came across this sushi restaurant on whim. They were able to seat us quickly for a smaller place and we were a group of 5. Its a BYOB, which is a huge plus! We got a lot of sushi rolls to share as a table and all of them were delicious and for a great price. Will definitely go back with some bottles of wine.

I went here on a whim on a Friday night with my boyfriend a couple weeks ago, and we had a great experience. I had heard a lot of great things about this place, so I was eager to try it. If I'm being honest, PokemonGo had just made its debut a week before, so we were excited to venture outside of our neighborhood to catch Pokemon...

We arrived around 7pm, and the wait was 45 minutes. We decided to wait since they'd text us when our table was ready, and there were two Pokemon Lures outside where 10+ people were congregating... Anyway, I digress...

We received a text about 25 minutes later that a table had opened up on the patio. Score! For an appetizer, we shared the Robata Sampler 2, which included two beef short ribs, two chicken satay, and two pork shoulder. All of them were DELICIOUS, but my favorite was the beef short rib.

For dinner, my boyfriend got the chicken teriyaki (he doesn't like sushi), which was plentiful. I ordered the Boy Meets World roll, which was super delicious. Definitely more on the spicy side. Service was great, especially considering our server was manning a few tables on her own.

Kinda on the pricier side, but nothing outrageous for robata and sushi. I would highly recommend!

So this place is known for their crazy sauce art on their jumbo rolls, but that doesn't mean they're sacrificing flavor at all! We ordered: 
Smoke salmon roll- came with 6 pieces and was absolutely delicious. Just smoked salmon and rice wrapped in nori, but so much flavor. 
Motown roll- (jumbo) smoked salmon, unagi, cream cheese, jalapeo, avocado, and tempura battered. Really tasty! The tempura was super light and flaky, and all the flavors went nicely together- the heat from the jalapeo paired really well with the cream cheese and smoked salmon. So good!
Avocado and cucumber- like the smoked salmon, just the avocado and cucumber with rice inside the nori. Pretty good, but if you're going to go vegetarian, we recommend the jumbo rolls that pack more of a punch. 
Coconut and crab- (jumbo) soft shell crab, unagi, avocado, cream cheese, topped with coconut flakes. Never had this combo before but dang was it good! Coconut and sushi? Not a combo I would have thought of but I'm really glad Yuzu did. 
Green Harbor- (jumbo) vegetarian roll with avocado, tempura broccoli and sweet potato, and cucumber. The broccoli was a little strong and made it harder to taste everything in the roll, but still a really option for vegetarians. 
Service was good and the staff was really nice! Also helpful in explaining ingredients if you don't know what something is. 
We'd love to come back and try more!

Well, Yuzu is fun, a little different, and apparently (I am told) authentically Japanese! For $ 30, there's a lot of options, salad, sashimi, rolls and so on. The servers wasn't that kind. The combination of the size of portion, atmosphere and food quality was OK, not awesome! 

For those who are living close to them, I recommend going there, but for those who are leaving a not that close, I would say go to another restaurant! I mean, the restaurant is good but not so special as I had expected! 

They didn't even make something special in my plate!!! The server refuse to bring more water after I paid the bill! 

Overall it was not that bad, but I won't return! Besides, come on after paid the bill I don't have a right to ask for water! No make sense!

Loved this place! So many options and so colorful! This place makes sushi fun.

Rolls can be huge! I was with another person so we both got one roll each to share and if we wanted more we'd order after. We were stuffed! 

BYOB & don't be shy because every table did it. White wine as far as the eye could see. They bring you a chilling bucket and ice for your table too. 

Can't wait to come back. Ordered the Breaking Bad Roll and Midwestern Roll. I preferred the latter hands down. 

And that's all I have to say about that.

I do not know why it has taken me so long to write this review! Yuzu is my favorite sushi spot in Chicago!  The get 5 stars in taste and presentation. The rolls here are incredibly creative and always come out looking beautiful. If you are not in the mood for sushi, they have a plethora of other options. The robata is great (grilled meats on skewers). 

Reservations are strongly recommended as Yuzu is always busy.

Solid BYOB sushi joint that I'd recommend for early dinner dates or later evening friend gatherings. The first time I was here on a date we came at about 6ish on a Saturday. The place was maybe at 50% capacity. The sushi was good. The serving blocks were beautifully decorated. I actually preferred the Nigiri over the rolls. The Unagi rolls were very meh...not much unagi in them so I would recommend the nigari Unagi. 

I made a reservation here again for a second date (different girl) cause I enjoyed it the first time. This time we came at 8pm on a Friday night and the whole vibe was different. 115% capacity and hip hop music was BUMPIN! I loved the vibe but the girl I was with was very soft spoken so I was kind of kicking myself. 

The service was on point and the mochi flight was awesome! I would definitely go back depending on who I'm with.

I eat sushi and/or poke multiple times a week and Yuzu has the best of the best!  I like to branch out and order something new every time I go because their menu has a lot more than just sushi. 

Sushi Rolls: The jumbo rolls all come on a wooden board with an intricate sauce design, I think everyone should experience it at least once! The sushi is so beautiful that it made my Facebook profile picture. Not only does the sauce look exquisite, but its taste compliments the roll. It can be spicy, sweet, savory, or anything in between depending on what roll you order. As for the rolls themselves, if any of them are listed as spicy, you have the option to get a non-spicy version. My favorite jumbo roll is the Motown Effect because it's deep fried and has all my favorite ingredients: salmon, cream cheese, avocado, and spicy mayo (also comes with eel, kani kama, and a few other typical sushi fillings). It's a lot to stomach and really fills you up so I would only order if you're pretty hungry. My other go-to's are the River Walk and Picasso because they are loaded with fresh fish (I'm generally not a fan of shrimp, so each roll that I've mentioned doesn't contain shrimp).

My favorite non-sushi item is the udon noodle soup served with mixed tempura. I have gotten it to share with my boyfriend as a kind of appetizer/side dish. It comes with giant shrimp, carrot, zucchini, and broccoli tempura which have the perfect crunch but don't taste greasy or unhealthy like some other places. The soup has a lot of amazingly thick udon noodles that are a struggle to get on a spoon; but the taste is worth the challenge! I definitely recommend it as an add-on to the sushi. 

Dessert: One time my friend and I received a complimentary dessert (assorted mochi) because they forgot to serve her food without sesame, like she asked. Of course they quickly brought out new rolls but the free mochi was a great touch and the servers were genuinely sorry about the mistake. We had lychee and strawberry flavors and it was super refreshing after the giant meal. 

The atmosphere is lively but intimate. They have rap music playing but it's not overbearing, there's anime art on the walls that's really cool to look at, and the lighting is dim without obstructing visibility of anything. The tables are kind of close together, but I usually go with one other person and it's like you're in your own world of sushi together even though it's usually packed. The servers are polite and efficient- so efficient to the point where they clarify how long you will be dining there so that their reservations run smoothly and they avoid overbooking. I would definitely make a reservation if you want to go after 6 pm. 

They have street parking and it's not hard to find (you might have to walk a block or two). It's free on Sundays!

One more thing: it's BYOB; they don't serve alcohol. There is a liquor store across the street and they have restrictions on both amount and type (you can only bring beer wine or sake).

After reading all the great reviews regarding Yuzu, I visited the restaurant with high expectations. All the pictures of their sushi looked amazing. The menu offerings sound delicious and the 4-5 star reviews seemed to back all the excellent ratings. So I bookmarked Yuzu with the hopes that my experience would be the same. 

My husband and I had arrived 15 minutes late to our dinner reservation so I had Ben call them en route to let them know we were going to be behind. They were kind enough to hold our spot so that was much appreciated.

At 6:15, our party of two finally arrives. We get seated at a tiny table. (Unfortunately there's no booth seating here). I sat on their communal bench along the wall, Ben sat across from me in a stylish yet uncomfortable metal chair. On top of that, our table was wobbly. I didn't mind it too much but it was bothering the hell out of my husband. Our water cups begin to splash all over as he sets his arms off the sides of the table. This incident alone already sparked a not so great first impression. I had to use my linen napkin to sop the water from the table while the waiter stood by; clearly seeing all this was happening. He never bothered to step in and at least acknowledge the problem. Only after my husband requested a change in table, did they finally correct this issue.

Anyways, onto our meals. We ordered 2 sushi rolls. The Dopest (a signature roll), and their spicy scallop. I'm the type that likes to look at the menu way before arriving to the restaurant and at first, the Dopest sounded promising. It had spicy tuna, Chipolte ranch, sliced pears, and I'm sure I'm leaving out some essential ingredients here, but it was topped off with slices of scallop and foie gras. I never had foie gras before so I thought, "What the hell.... We're here, why not give it a try?" So we ordered it. As usual, my attempt at trying the complex and fancy bit me in the ass. There's just too much going on in this roll. Perhaps I don't have a complex or sophisticated enough palette, but the pears weren't necessary here. In addition

Came here for my birthday dinner last night! Made reservations day of without a problem, but definitely make reservations (call by phone) before you go. We got tuna poke and bang bang shrimp to share and they were UNBELIEVABLE. The rolls are definitely the way to go here... food as art. I got the dopest roll (no, that's what it's called) which is tuna with a whole bunch of crazy topped off by foie gras... insane. But in a really really good way.

Pro tip: skip the sashimi and get any of the rolls. Have your camera at the ready!!

If I get maki I am looking for a base of the dynamic trio: cucumber, avocado and eel sauce. Almost every roll here has them, so there are many I would like to try. Depending on your roll (if it has a sauce) they create art work by dying the sauce with colors and it is quite pretty and unique, the sauce art very ornate and colorful.

I will look forward to the next time I get to come.

Yuzu is phenomenal.  I went there with my mother when she was visiting town because we are the only two that are adventurous and love sushi.  We brought our own wine since it is BYOB!

Food
- robata squid- a little too burnt for me, I wouldn't get it again but the sauce was awesome
- chicken sausage with truffle- wow, I was speechless, this was amazing!!
- Over the rainbow roll- one of the best rolls I have ever had! Great if you like tuna, salmon, and fresh crunch from cucumbers and tempura crumbs

I am definitely coming back, but will be sure to make reservations again because it was hopping and packed on a Thursday evening!  I would guess you should make the reservation at least a week in advance for weekends but that's a guess.

My mom made a comment that she wouldn't expect the place to look like that for the food we got and the presentation.  Meaning it was fine dining in a cool eclectic hipster brick interior.  We loved that surprise and could not have asked for a more positive and fun experience!!

Full disclosure: I'm a sucker for BYOB places. Especially ones without a corkage fee! 

We went to Yuzu on a wednesday. I'd called and made reservations in advance... only to have had made them for the wrong day. However, they were super accommodating and were able to get us seated right away!

I got the Chicken Satay robata and Green Harbor sushi. The robata was delicious, but i wish there was more for the price. They served me the wrong sushi and luckily I was too busy taking pictures of it to eat it. They came a few minutes later and asked if I'd eaten any of the shrimp sushi, I said no, and they proceeded to serve it 2 tables over...... uh.. no.

Another 15 minutes later I got my vegetarian sushi. The Green Harbor sushi had the most beautiful design on it! However, the sushi itself was massive and hard to eat. It pretty much broke apart any time I tried to pick it up. I wish it was smaller and slightly more flavorful. 

For dessert I wanted the matcha mousse thing, but they were out. Super disappointing. I've seen other Yelpers complain about that too.. soooo stock up Yuzu!!

Overall, cute place to checkout. BYOB is a huge plus. The designs on the sushi are so unique and make the whole experience better!

This was my favorite sushi restaurant.  We revisited it last  week only to find that the menu has changed.  Many of our favorites have been eliminated.  The"special" rolls weren't as delicious as before but the sushi was still excellent.  The robata lamb chops no longer available, but the asparagus and bacon skewers were available but at a ridiculous price of $5 per skewer.  Place is so noisy you can't hear the person sitting opposite.  The food came out so fast there was no room on the table.  Obviously they wanted us to eat quickly and leave. Not pleasant at all. We'll think twice before returning.

Fantastic sushi! I honestly didn't think I'd find such good sushi in the west loop. Even though this place is very American, as it caters to American tastes, I still thought the food was delicious, high quality and unique. The rolls are fantastic, not a single one I didn't like. We ordered the spicy tuna, sweet potato, Midwest, and another roll with cream cheese. I like trying vegetarian rolls because restaurants should make sure their non carnivorous customers aren't miserable. I really liked the the sweet potato roll because it was fried just enough and was seasoned well-it wasn't just plain potato. My spicy tuna was mild at best for obvious reasons, but it was still delicious. Midwest roll had a great amount of crunch and flavor and I loved that they put the sauce on the side rather than dousing the roll. Most other American sushi places do this and it's overkill. And the grilled red onions on top were a surprising delight. The rolls have a great fish to rice ratio. But omg the uni and tuna poke were amazing. Uni was buttery and not funky at all. It's like ocean butter. Poke was citrusy and complex. And they're easy to share. I would definitely come back and the bill ended up being about $27 per person before tip-a reasonable price for great cuisine!

I've been wanting to try this place out for quite some time and today I finally tried it. Make reservation before going. 
My boyfriend and I love sushi but I honestly have to say there sushi is just decent. The service is great and friendly. The vibe in the restaurant is good. It's a cute sushi restaurant with anime around the walls. 

The sushi chiefs does cute drawings with the sauce which is amazing. We ordered from the regular rolls and special rolls. The regular ones didn't have any drawings but the special ones did. This place is pretty pricy but it's worth the money to try it out. 

We may come back but will see.

Awesome Sushi spot! 
Came here with a large group of coworkers with no issues at all. We made reservations earlier in the day. Every dish was presented uniquely and beautifully. Love that they create such amazing, colorful presentations.
I got the Motown Effect, so good!
At the end, they all gave us a deal on desserts. We all shared the Matcha & Chocolate Charlotte and The White Chocolate Yuzu. The Match one was absolutely my favorite! Delicious combinations of flavors going on.

Aside from dining in, our work always orders catering with Yuzu. They are the best and very accommodating. They even created a Sushi burrito one time for us. Love Yuzu!

Went for a friend's birthday- BYOB definitely a bonus. We had great service, there was a short wait time, and best of all- the sushi was delicious! All of us enjoyed the Picasso roll the most out of 8+ rolls we ordered. 

Our waitress was very accommodating. My friend who's birthday we were celebrating could not have their normal birthday celebration dessert due to dietary restrictions and so she suggested they decorated a roll for him so we could still sing and have a sparkler! Great customer service and left a large group of happy (and full) customers!

Atmosphere: Definitely a trendy place. The place was pretty dimly lit and the music was a tad too loud than I would have liked but nothing too distracting. Lots of small tables set up pretty close together so if you're looking for an intimate vibe, might not be the best place. The place filled up pretty quickly and was full by the time we left (6:30 pm) so definitely make a reservation if you can!

Food: We got the Dragon roll, Black sea, and Boston crunchy roll. Overall, the presentation was very nice - they made a colorful dragon to go with our roll! However taste wise, I would say there are definitely better places for sushi. The rolls just didn't have a wow factor for me and pretty unmemorable. 

Overall, I would consider coming back if I was in the area but not make it a destination. It is pretty cool that they do BYOB and conveniently, there's a liquor store right across the street so that's definitely a perk. However, I would say save your money and go to Forbidden Root across the street if you want drinks (either before or after dinner) since that place is bomb.

Ps. they have mouthwash and feminine hygiene products in the bathroom which is awesome so bonus points for that!

Very overrated place! Went in based on my sister's recommendation and I ordered the same roll she ordered. It looked nothing like what she ordered when she was here awhile back. The art they put on the sushi was pathetically simple and half hearted. The sushi had too much rice and was nothing special. Best thing about the meal was a mediocre green tea latte. This place is all aesthetics (when they feel like trying) and the food is below average. Don't waste your time coming here.

Came here for dinner with friends after work on a weekday, and it was packed. I would recommend making a reservation.

My favorite dish here was actually the chicken karaage appetizer. The portion was large and it was fried perfectly. The sushi was also pretty good, but nothing particularly special. The sauce art was a nice touch and a good instagram opportunity.

Ambiance was nice, and the service was good. I'll definitely come back one day.

I came here back in March with my boyfriend for dinner. We were crazy and decided to do 2 dinners the same day again...haha 

We didn't have reservations so we came right when it open and got seated right away. We ordered two rolls and the mochi ice cream. All was very good, and the table next to us kept eyeing our food as they waited for theirs. 

Some of their rolls comes with creative designs from the sauces. 

This place is BYOB but we weren't in the mood to drink yet since it was ONLY our first dinner. This place gets a lil dim so it's more a romantic setting. 

OH, ALMOST FORGOT, I really liked their wall decorations. All that anime :D

I came here by bus and it dropped us right on the street. There's also a few bars nearby if you want to continue drinking after drinking here.

Worth the price. 
The salmon sashimi is very high quality and it melted in my mouth. 
The rolls are good. The one with tempera is well done. Sauce is great and adds up layers of flavors and the tempera is very crispy and not oily (ofc).
I didn't go for the presentation (which is what most of the people went there for). I highly recommend to order specific sushi you like, so you will know how good this restaurant is.

I have been going to Yuzu for the last two years, and it has always been my number one recommended sushi spot. The food is delicious and the ambiance is hipster chic at its finest. I have tried multiple rolls and they never disappoint. Not only is the food scrumptious, but the presentation is unmatched by anything I've ever seen. Intricate and colorful designs, made from sauces, are displayed with your sushi. If you order the "Chicago roll" you will get a Chicago skyline made out of spicy mayo and food dye. 

One of my favorite aspects of Yuzu is the fact that it's BYOB. However, don't try to break their alcohol rule because they won't allow it. One bottle of wine per 2 people. If you are a beer drinker, I believe you can bring a six pack per 2 people. 

With this being said, Yuzu has become one of my favorite date night spots and just a great place in general for different vibes and great food. However, I will never recommend Yuzu again. Please read on if you'd like to know why. 

The alcohol rule is annoying, and so is the fact that they try to rush you and turn over tables quickly. However, the customer service at Yuzu is the reason why I will not recommend this restaurant. Their customer service is the worst I have ever seen. I worked in the restaurant industry for two summers in college, and I have seen what good customer service is. I am also a frequent restaurant goer and have experienced poor customer service. The way the manager at Yuzu treated me, was unacceptable. 

Since Yuzu is quite small, I made sure to call early to book my birthday dinner. I called on January 3rd to make a reservation for 10 people for February 24th. I specifically asked if any tables would fit 10 people and they said it wouldn't be a problem. I assumed that they would put two tables together or that they had a table large enough for 10. 

The day before my reservation, I didn't hear anything from the restaurant. I figured I should call to confirm. The manager wasn't in and contrary to what the host told me, the manager didn't get back to me when she said she would. I ended up calling three times, and emailing, to finally get ahold of the manager. The manager nonchalantly told me that I was crazy and that I never made a reservation at all, because they would never accept a reservation for a party that large. 

This conversation went on for ten minutes. She was extremely rude, extremely belittling, and entirely unhelpful. She said my phone number wasn't even in their system, even though I had made somewhere between 10-20 reservations there over the course of the last two years. 

When you call almost two months early to make a reservation, you trust that the person on the other end of the phone is going to actually write it down. However, that isn't the case here. It was really fun trying to find a reservation for 10 people on a Friday night, less than 24 hours before. We ended up going to Butterfly sushi and not only was the food delicious, but they allowed us to have as many drinks as we wanted and they didn't rush us out. They were extremely accommodating and kind to us, as they should be. 

Food wise and vibe wise, I would recommend this restaurant. However, the customer service is so god awful that it is no longer at the top of my list. I will continuously tell people about this horrible experience, because it was an experience I won't forget. Two stars because the food is good and the presentation is fun.

I've been wanting to try this place out for quite some time and today I finally tried it. Make reservation before going. 
My boyfriend and I love sushi but I honestly have to say there sushi is just decent. The service is great and friendly. The vibe in the restaurant is good. It's a cute sushi restaurant with anime around the walls. 

The sushi chiefs does cute drawings with the sauce which is amazing. We ordered from the regular rolls and special rolls. The regular ones didn't have any drawings but the special ones did. This place is pretty pricy but it's worth the money to try it out. 

We may come back but will see.

Awesome Sushi spot! 
Came here with a large group of coworkers with no issues at all. We made reservations earlier in the day. Every dish was presented uniquely and beautifully. Love that they create such amazing, colorful presentations.
I got the Motown Effect, so good!
At the end, they all gave us a deal on desserts. We all shared the Matcha & Chocolate Charlotte and The White Chocolate Yuzu. The Match one was absolutely my favorite! Delicious combinations of flavors going on.

Aside from dining in, our work always orders catering with Yuzu. They are the best and very accommodating. They even created a Sushi burrito one time for us. Love Yuzu!

Went for a friend's birthday- BYOB definitely a bonus. We had great service, there was a short wait time, and best of all- the sushi was delicious! All of us enjoyed the Picasso roll the most out of 8+ rolls we ordered. 

Our waitress was very accommodating. My friend who's birthday we were celebrating could not have their normal birthday celebration dessert due to dietary restrictions and so she suggested they decorated a roll for him so we could still sing and have a sparkler! Great customer service and left a large group of happy (and full) customers!

Went to Yuzu last night and it was just perfect. The ambiance is very low lighting, cute, small, artsy place. The music they were playing was so good! However, I do think it appeals to a younger crowd (old and new hip hop). My boyfriend and I loved it. We had the bang shrimp (amazing), chicken gyoza, pork shoulder and chicken satay robata, tempura udon noodles, river walk roll.... Everything was great and the service was too. Our check was only about $55 for dinner!

Plus, it's BYOB! :)

Amazing appetizers, rolls, service, and atmosphere!

The staff were very attentive and our server took our orders right away and brought out the food in a timely manner. He always made sure our water cups were full and we were satisfied!

We ordered the Tuna Pok, Chicken Sausage Truffle, and the Black Bean Chicken. The Tuna Pok was super flavorful, had a nice kick to it, and so fresh! The Chicken Sausage was also very delicious as was the Black Bean Chicken. Everything was cooked to perfection. 

For Yuzu rolls, we ordered the Summer Ocean+Breeze, Born to Chill, and the Dragon Roll. All of the rolls were seriously SO good and very filling. The sauce art was also amazing! The sauces range from colored Japanese mayo to eel sauce. 

The decor inside is very cool and just sets the mood. I loved everything about my experience there, so I will def be back!

I came here mainly because of the pictures I saw. Their sushi platters are decorated with sauces drawn like dragons or flowers.

We made the mistake of not making a reservation. So, we had to wait for about 40 mins. The host was very friendly and texted us when our table was ready. We ordered:
-Hokkaido scallops, which were off the menu (5/5)
-Pier 69 (4/5)
-Bacon wrapped quail eggs (5/5)

I'd highly recommend the bacon wrapped quail eggs. Not sure if the hokkaido scallops will still be around, since it's a seasonal offering, but they were fresh and delicious! The Pier 69 rolls were good, but I wouldn't say they're extraordinary. They taste pretty similar to most other rolls offered by sushi restaurants. However, do order the rolls if you want a beautiful work of sauce art!

Yuzu was kind enough to accept our incredibly last minute party of six and we were seated promptly upon arrival. Atmosphere is casual, yet romantic. We celebrated a Birthday, but we saw many families as well as couples.

As for the food - everything was absolutely delicious. We sampled many rolls including the Picasso, Breaking Bad, and Sin Nombre (my three personal favorites). Sushi was presented as it was prepared, each "Jumbo Roll" was presented with aesthetic design. The Breaking Bad has a perfect "kick" to it, and was presented with a fried ginger garnish which really took the roll up a level.

Service was quick and friendly, we experienced no issues. Fish was all fresh and a generous serving for the price point. I'm torn whether or not to include photos, as I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise - but the sushi is pure Art!

My FAVORITE Sushi restaurant in the whole wide world !

Everything about this place is perfect !

The mouthwatering melt in your mouth like butter sashimi . The Tuna Poke .The amazing Rolls .The Presentation. The Hip Hop music . The Manga art covering the walls . The BYOB ! The friendly service . Just Perfect !

My only complaint is I have spent the last two Valentines days here and both years they hire musicians to come in and perform live and IMO they were cheesy . I get that they were trying to set a romantic mood but it wasn't doing it for me and It felt kinda Kenny G-ish . Keep the Hip Hop which is what you're known for or maybe next year have a soul vocalist or hip hop cover band playing hip hop love songs ! They exist and I can give you the playlist ! Besides is there anything more romantic than Wu-Tang  playing in the background on Valentines day ? :)

Hands down, some of the most beautiful presentation I've seen on ANY food (and I dine out a lot). Sushi was fresh, tasty and the maki selection included things I'd never seen before.

Ambiance was right too. Hip hop and 90s Snoop, Ice Cube, etc. had me busting out rhymes while I enjoyed my food.

And BYOB means the price is ALWAYS right.

Excellent food at reasonable prices, in a comfortable spot. This is a busy place. The first time I came, they told us it would be a 60+ minute wait, then seated us 15 minutes later after we'd gone elsewhere to kill time (?). Second time we wised up and made a reservation. BYOB and they really shuttle you in and out. But man that food was good.

This place is BYOB.  I brought a bottle of gin. I also brought my friends. One of them brought his ukulele and the friendly staff brought us a giant bowl of sashimi and some other sushi plates that we each took turns eating and critiquing.

"This one is rubbery."

"The pinkish one is glorious."

"Yeah, but I think it's really overfished and on the verge of extinction by the year 2025." 

"We're disgusting people. Pour me some more goddamn gin."

"You know what would lighten the mood? A song on your ukulele."

"I only brought it as a joke. I don't actually play the thing."

"More gin, now!"

It went on and on like this for a while, and finally we ordered some vegetable robatas, fish-free apps and something else, I don't remember, the gin had taken over, to ease our guilt, but the damage was done and not even the wonderful presentation and friendly server could make the world's harsh realities go away. 

I would come back, though.

The wife and I visited Yuzu for the first time on a Friday night. We arrived at 6pm without reservations and was able to snag a small table near the sushi chefs. As many reviewers have said, call ahead and make reservations if at all possible. Around 6:15pm the restaurant was packed and people were waiting by the door for open tables. 

Our only regret for the evening was that we didn't visit Yuzu sooner! From the robata grill, we ordered the Korean style Beef Short Rib ($3.00) and Pork Shoulder with sweet Thai chili sauce ($3.50). Both were on a small single skewer with four tiny pieces. Portions were small but that was expected, both were flavorful. For sushi, we ordered the River Walk ($16) and Dragon ($15) special rolls. Both rolls were very large portions, enough to share for two hungry people and very flavorful. 

The service was great. Our server came by repeatedly to fill our waters and check in. Yuzu has a very trendy, hip vibe, with exposed brick walls, Japanese anime art and dark wood tables. 

Our new favorite sushi restaurant. Thank you Yuzu!

Even though I'm not supposed to eat sushi because it's bad for me, I don't care when it comes to Yuzu sushi! 

I love everything about this place, from the modern-japanese-anime decor, to the amazing and well-arranged food! I ordered the famous "dragon roll", huge rolls that are accompanied by sauces arranged into a shape of a dragon. The rolls were delicious and I could tell that the food artists were talented by the way that the sauce art looked. Every order of the dragon roll comes with a different but still awesome variation of dragon art. I also ordered a poke bowl- which is good. It's sweet and has a unique taste, it's similar to the poke bowls in Hawai'i. My boyfriend ordered the sushi burrito and it was like taking a bite out of something from another planet... it tastes like sushi but there's something about it that makes it so different from any Japanese dish I've ever tasted. The portions of every dish were good for the price! And to top it off, the miso soup (which is my favorite soup ever) was delicious and complimented all of the dishes very well. 

I look forward to coming here again even though I'll likely have digestion problems right after

I LOVE THIS PLACE. Not only is it BYOB and the music is great. There is a roll for everyone's tastes here ! I personally am a sushi freak so I love everything. The artwork made of sauces is gorgeous and the service is always impeccable. I would give this 10 stars if I could !

A few friends & I had dinner there tonight. I called earlier in the day to make a reservation because it was recommended by Yelp to do so on a Friday night. I called around noon & they were able to fit my group of 4 in at 7 o'clock. I was asked if I would be able to be done by 8:30 because they had a party reservation coming in. It was unusual to be asked that, but I didn't mind too much. I received a text confirmation of my reservation in addition to a few rules they had about arriving late or arriving with a party larger than you had booked for.

The atmosphere was chill & relaxing. It is a BYOB & there are limits (1 750-ml wine bottle for two people, 6 beer bottles for two people). Hard liquor wasn't allowed, but beer, wine, & sake were. It was dim lighting & quite noisy. So you'll definitely have to talk a bit louder to hear one another.

I ordered the beef short rib robata, which I found to be reminiscent of what you would find at a Korean BBQ place. I did like it though. It was well cooked, juicy, slightly fatty, & flavorful. Mine was delivered to the table hot off the grill. I got a Dragon Ball jumbo roll & it was good. There wasn't anything spectacular about it, but it was delicious. I really enjoyed that they created artwork with the sauces instead of just drizzling it on top. It allows you to dip & mix as you wanted. 

Service was quick & our waitress was friendly & efficient. There were extremely busy when we arrived, so I would definitely call for a reservation on busier days. Keep in mind that if you're 10 minutes late, they'll automatically cancel your reservation.

happy eating!

Very satistified with my experience. We got 11 rolls and they were delicious. My favorite would have to be the river walk and thug life. Some of the rolls were okay. I expected breaking bad to be better but it was very sweet and the fried ginger wasn't the greatest. Rainbow rolls were okay. They didn't have much flavor. I would highly recommend this place to  others!

We came for my husband's birthday and were ready to splurge. We ordered the Omakase (~$130/person) with the Waygu beef add-on (~$40/person). The Omakase is definitely portioned out to be a full meal (served in a variety of pre-selected small plates) and left both of us stuffed with leftovers to take home.

Favorites:
 - Yuzu Miso Marinated Black Cod was the MOST delicious dish. So buttery and savory and flaky!!!
 - Waygu is so tender and decadent. It's served in a smaller potion but it's a meat to be savored! 
 - Amberjack nigiri and the sashimi platter. Great variety and very fresh fish! 
 - Japanese whisky selection is quite expansive. The Yamazaki 18 year (~$50 per pour) is so smooth that even I liked it! 

Next favorites/runner-ups:
 - Scallops with gooseberries and butter sauce. This dish had great variety of textures and some different flavors with the gooseberries
 - Brussels Sprouts. I always love Brussels sprouts and this was no exception
 - Ribeye with Wafu sauce... while ribeye is definitely not my favorite cut of meat, the Wafu dressing is drinkable!!! 
 - Delicious birthday dessert with tons of variety and a nice/attentive move! 

Downsides:
 - The Omakase meal seemed low on sushi/sashimi/nigiri/steak dishes with too many veggies... Definitely could have done without the Roasted Best Salad, Asparagus and the LARGE rice dish that we both did not enjoy. 
 - Getting charged for edamame at the start
 - There were things I LOVED and then there were things that were ok, but I expect to LOVE everything when dropping over $200 per person

I would come again and pick the dishes that we loved rather than going the Omakase route again. For Omakase in Chicago, I'll continue to head over to Kai Zan!

Fine sushi dining at its best!  The food, the ambiance and service are great. You can easily drop $100 for food per person here but it would all be worth it.  The food is so good I eat until I almost burst when I come here. 

The dishes here are not merely food, but beautiful art creations.  They are not just a sushi restaurant as they also offer prime steaks, seafood and vegetable dishes.  

It's an open kitchen design where you can see the chefs.  Everything I tried was amazing and either melted in my mouth like delicious liquid velvet or exploded with flavors leaving no taste buds untouched.

Some of the things I tried:
Beef Tataki with shaved black truffle and truffle jus $22 - This is my favorite dish here
Wagyu gyoza $11
Vegetable tempura $9
Butterfish Tataki with White Asparagus and Yuzu $13
Salmon Nigiri $9
Hamachi Nigiri $9
Chu Toro $16
Soft Shell Maki $14
Brussel Sprout $7
Chocolate cake $12
Green tea custard $10
Old Fashioned drink $13

There are paid street parking, which may be difficult to find.

By far I have been to Roka three times and their happy hour was definitely a huge bang for your buck!

$1 oysters and $5 apps and sushi rolls! We were stuffed and extremely happy for just about $40 per person eating such premium ingredients! We ordered so many that they ran out way quickly than usual. The managers seemed super friendly and nice and very attentive. Our server was extremely friendly as well (same girl that served us last time)

The oysters were fresh and the sauce they paired it with was absolutely delicious! Also loved their gyoza and crispy squid! Would totally come back again and again and again!

Came for happy hour with a group of friends Friday at 5pm and was seated immediately in the beautiful and modern lounge. A server came by to take our drink orders right away. I got the specialty cocktail ($5) which was a grapefruit/tequila drink for that day. They definitely don't skimp on the alcohol :) 

For food, we got a bunch of plates to share. I really enjoyed the fried calamari ($5) - deliciously crispy and flavorful. It was so good we got 2 orders! The signature tataki trio ($6) was definitely my favorite. The fish was super fresh and perfectly paired. Nothing else on the menu really stood out. If I come back, it'll just be for those two dishes + drinks.

The food here is phenomenal!!!! Flavor, flare, and fun!

I was expecting it to be a sushi restaurant but was pleasantly surprised roka is more of a Japanese grill.  Don't get me wrong they have some great sushi rolls but their entrees and sides are even better.

I pretty much loved everything I ate.  Some of my favorites were Salmon teriyaki which fell apart because it was cooked so perfectly, scallop appetizer, jalapeo roll, shrimp roll, and my most favorite of the night was the black truffle rice.  Someone will come to your table to mix up the rice and put some truffle shavings in.  Needless to say I was stuffed when I left because I ate so much. Luckily I had a few friends to help.

The service was also top notch and our waiter was great at dividing the check evenly.  Will definitely recommend this place to friends!

What a cool ambiance and vibe to this place.
Tasty heirloom tomatoes, King crab Cali rolls. Wagyu beef with kimchi was tasty to all that ate and tried it. I was beyond impressed by Aaron, he was our waiter, very attentive and even replaced the white napkin for my friend, who was wearing a black cloth dress to avoid getting lint on her dress, that was really impressive to me, love the attention to detail.

This review is solely for the Korean Spiced Lamb Cutlets because God they were delicious and outshine anything else. I visited Roka Akor about a month ago. It was the best lamb I've ever tasted and is absolutely unforgettable. 

The restaurant was nice, though slightly overpriced, as are most in that area. Service was good. I went on a weekday with reservations and was seated immediately. I would also recommend the Wagyu Beef and Kimchi Dumplings 4/5. Sweet corn was good too.

After returning from Las Vegas where we had amazing dining experiences at Nobu and Morimoto, we really struggled to find something comparable in Chicago. There is supposedly a Nobu opening up next year along with its own hotel, but I'll believe it when I see it. In any case, we saw the reviews and A5 on the menu at Roka Akor in Chicago and had to try it for our anniversary.

We requested and was sat at a booth near the wine cellar, so that was fine. We did have one snafu with the busser when we arrived - when asking if we wanted bottled or tap, we asked what was on bottle. He told us Acqua Panna (my favorite bottled water) so we agreed. But instead he brought out San Benedetto which I didn't like. And at $8 per bottle, seemed very mediocre. I don't recommend this water.

Anyway, onto the food! Our server was very nice and made note to take into consideration some of our food restrictions. We ordered off the menu and did not do an Omakase or tasting menu because we are a bit picky with what we like/don't like. The meal came with a tofu amuse bouche that was good. Our favorite starters were the Beef Tataki, Escolar Tataki, Yellowtail, and Toro Tatare. AMAZING. We did not care for the Madai Crudo or the Wagyu Gunkan.

The main entrees we had were the skirt steak with truffle aioli and add on bone marrow and the A5 ribeye. These dishes were soooooo good. I cannot even describe how good they are!! I've never had a more tender skirt. And the A5 was just melt in your mouth. We were extremely happy with how everything turned out!

Our waiter was also really great and acknowledged our anniversary with a purple potato pot de creme dessert that was surprisingly delicious! We will be back for sure!!

We made reservations and went here as a group of 8 for a birthday/surprise proposal. The decor is great with low lighting for ambiance. The service was also great. They allowed us to bring our own cake for the birthday celebration and answered all of our questions regarding the menu. They recommended some delicious cocktail drinks. I've been to a few different higher end steak/sushi restaurants and Roka Akor is worth the visit.  The food was delicious. It was hard to choose from their extensive menu. We ordered a variety of appetizers and rolls and were very satisfied with everything we selected. My favorites would have to be The Wagyu beef and pork belly dishes. They were melt in your mouth delicious.  Though the menu is on the pricier side, it's definitely worth going for any type of celebration, whether as a large group like we did or date. Definitely make reservations though they don't require them. It's just easier to go, knowing you won't have to wait for a table. They definitely stay busy.

This is a super late post since we ate here before celebrating New Year's at the Drake Hotel. 

The restaurant had a New Year's omakase dinner special.  It was nice since we didn't have to choose anything out of their huge menu.  The hostess and waiter explained everything that came out and gave us a very personable experience though I can't remember everything writing this 7 months later. 

Everything that came out was amazing! 
They had this red miso soup with chunks of lobster,  a tuna tartare with quail egg,  fresh sashimi platter with freshly grated wasabi root, wagyu beef with truffle butter, king crab in chili lime sauce, a seared fish, beef appetizers,  and molten chocolate cake with green tea icecream... can't remember every detail but my taste buds were happily dancing.  I was spoiled with an amazing experience.  Highly recommend!

We were in town for the Chicago Marathon this weekend and had a really excellent dinner at Roka Akor. A friend joined me and my wife, so we ordered a bit more than usual:

Appetizers:
Waygu Beef & Kimchi Dumplings: 5/5 - really excellent
Robata Grilled Scallops - also delicious!

Mains:
The chef's selection Nigiri rolls were incredible - this alone was worth the trip - very fresh fish, although the sushi rice could have used a touch more vinegar, but that's not a huge drawback with excellent fish

Maki rolls: Tuna Four Ways and Crispy Prawn/Chirashi - both tasty, but not as good as the nigiri rolls - overall very nice

Salmon Teriyaki - perfectly cooked, seasoned just right - a must have if you aren't in the mood for sushi.

Sides- the brussels sprouts were delicious and the sweet potatoes lasted all of 10 seconds they were so good!

The service at Roka Akor is also excellent - and while this is on the expensive end of restaurants in the area, it's worth it if you enjoy really excellent, fresh fish.

+ recently tried the lamb cutlets and enjoyed them, although I wish they weren't so well done/on the dry side

- my favorite dish, the Chilean sea bass, was recently changed in terms of its accompanying broth--it used to be a simple, soy-based (?) broth that was light and elegant, but now it's been replaced with carrot miso or something along those lines and I feel like they ruined a good thing. Many of my friends whom I've recommended Roka to (along with specific dishes to order) have all loved the sea bass dish. I'm sad they changed it and that it's no longer available--I asked for it and the waiter said it couldn't be done since the broth is pre made 

Anyway, Roka's current highlights imo are the nigiri and robata grill items

Mediocre and overpriced Japanese steakhouse/sushi/fusion spot north of the river. The food is not memorable, except in the sense that I remember paying for a meal I didn't particularly enjoy. The service is also poor, we barely saw our server, he was short with us and wasn't interested in making the experience a good one.

We started with some apps - crispy squid, escolar tataki, and wagyu/kimchi dumplings. Crispy squid was my favorite, but it wasn't amazing by any means. The dumplings were dumplings, and the tataki was fine but none of us were crazy about it.

I ordered the modern nigiri plate for dinner. The fish did not have much flavor and the accoutrements made that little flavor it did have disappear. I had a side of the mushroom rice, which was my favorite dish of the night (basically a mushroom risotto). Also tried the skirt steak and sides of sweet potatoes and mushroom skewers which were ok as well.

Overall, it's not a bad meal, but when the meal is 60-70 a person I have certain expectations of quality of ingredients, execution, and service and roka misses the mark.

My last meal in Chicago, I didn't feel like stuffing myself with something heavy before a long flight. I found this upscale Japanese restaurant within walking distance and gave it a try.

The restaurant at the time had a special menu, "Celebrate Chicago Chefs" which included a three course lunch for $22 per person.

- Course One: Robata Grilled Japanese Shishito Peppers with Ponzu & Bonito Flakes
- Course Two: Wagyu Beef and Kimchi Dumplings AND Spicy Duo Tuna Maki
- Course Three: Chirashi - Assorted Sashimi over Rice

I ordered one of the special menu and one of the Roka Bento Style Lunch - Sushi Set $22. The bento lunch included Miso Soup, Crispy Butterfish Maki, Wagyu Dumplings in addition to the Flame Seared Salmon Nigiri, Hamachi Sashimi and Spicy Tuna Roll.

The Shishito Peppers could have used another minute on the grill but I still enjoyed the snapping crunch with the ponzu sauce. The combination of wagyu beef and kimchi was explosive. This dumpling was no joke. It had great flavor and didn't need the dipping sauce.

The fresh fish was nothing outstanding and some of the maki cuts were inconsistent. The Chirashi was more for presentation and sampling rather than a full meal. I'm not a big fan of diced fish on my Chirashi but rather sashimi slices. Again, it's more of a decoration at best and smaller than a musubi.

The interior was contemporary and sleek. I especially loved the color and style with the natural flow of the restaurant. Starting from the entrance, the service was impeccable throughout the meal. The staff was extremely attentive and always keep my hot water pot full.

If you're looking for a power lunch or just to hang out, Roka Akor is a good alternative. I love the idea of bento sets for lunch as it gives you a little bit of everything.

Couple of us went with the chefs choice tasting menu, which I highly recommend. They fuel the grill with nothing but hardwood, and the flavor definitely translated into the tender wagyu beef. The platter of sashimi that came served on a bed of ice represented the finest cuts of fish you could ask for... and I've eaten plenty. That's just to mention a couple highlights. Go...eat...the FOOD!

Roka Akor was a fabulous pick for my birthday dinner. I had made an 8:45 reservation for which my whole party arrived on time. We waited near the bar and ordered some drinks in the mean time. I asked for a custom lychee martini and it was incredible! We were probably waiting upwards to a half hour for our table to clear when a gentleman walked us back to their private room area which we would be seated at instead for the inconvenience.

Everyone in my party really enjoyed the food and ordered for the table. My best friend and I who are vegetarian found the vegetarian items to be delicious. There was a mixup in some of my friends orders and so they provided an appetizer on the house. Sarah our waitress was very kind and accommodating! 

We had a great time. There was no rush at all and the staff was very patient with my small but rowdy party. A fabulous cake was provided as well. 

Will most definitely be back. Roka would make a great place for a date!

The staff recommended the lamb-special, with the side of brussel sprouts, omg it was amazing! Usually lamb tents to have a residue smell, but this lamb was cooked just perfect! If I'm ever in Chicago again, I am definitely going back for the lamb!

fusion, just be aware this is fusion food and moves outside of the box of traditional japanese. i thought i was going to get a traditional omakase but instead greeted with one giant plate of fresh fish and the remaining dishes being hot.

not a bad change but not exactly what i was expecting.

After close to two years living in Chicago, I can finally say I have a favorite restaurant.

Y'all. I can't believe it took me this long to actually try Roka Akor. I never ever cook, and as many of the restaurants Ive been to in Chicago, I can confidently proclaim that Roka Akor has stolen my heart and the #1 spot on my favorites list to dine in the city.

Location: Roka Akor sits right in the heart of River North on the corner. Its very close to a plethora of hotels, bars, other restaurants, salons, etc. Consequently, you'd think that it would be a tourist trap and/or busy at all times. It is not. Which is a definite shame.

Decor: Very modern. Very sleek. Very chic. My favorite part about the decor in Roka Akor is the dining room near the grill where you have "lit lighting" my definition for when you have the perfect lighting for selfies and/or fancy food photography. In addition to great lighting, the views of the street are spectacular thanks to the floor to ceiling windows.

Service: Impeccable. From the second you walk through the door, to the second you exit, A+mazing customer service all around. HUGE shout out and thanks to my server Seung. He was very informative and extremely pleasant and attentive, but not to the point that it seemed as if he was hovering. Just great.

Food: I will dream of this food. I will dream of the displays. I will come back time and time again. I ordered a few items and each and every dish was spectacular.

Wagyu Beef and Kimchi Dumplings: These are not your average potstickers. The quality of the wagyu mixed with the acidity of the kimchi, wrapped in a homemade dumpling, and crisped to the heavens, I downed all of these bad boys. Thank the gods I decided to dine alone. I would have been sad had I been coerced into sharing. They were tender, juicy (overflowing with juice), and succulent. Please order these.

Chef's 3 Sashimi Platter: The freshest fish I've had thus far in Chicago! Truly. This was my first time ever trying sashimi. I have been on a mission to truly expand my palette to things ordinary folks might not enjoy: raw fish is one of those things. I was absolutely blown away by the beautiful display on which they were served, but I was even more infatuated by how different each fish tasted. My favorite was the tuna, then the salmon, then the yellowtail. But all were good.

The Brussels Sprouts: Fan. tas. tic. I inhaled these babies. The sauce that they were tossed in provided the ultimate kick and zing to the earthy essence of the sprouts. And because they were crisped, the crunch was such a treat to the moist chewy consistency of the fish and the dumplings. Get them. Thank me later.

The Prime Ribeye: HEAVENLY! DIVINE! No other words. I am a steak snob. I get seriously angry when a steak isnt prepared well. Definitely not the case at RA. Each and every single bite, the cow melted in my mouth. Bursting with flavor and spices, each bite had me terrified I was about to finish the plate. When I did, I almost cried. But then I realized I still had dessert coming.

The Warm Chocolate Cake: Decadent. High quality chocolate. If you have room for dessert, do yourself a favor and end your meal on a high note. This did not disappoint. 

5 stars. In each and every way. I am thankful for restaurants like Roka Akor.

Roka Akor, aka my favorite restaurant in Chicago! I have been here twice, both during restaurant week. The restaurant week deal is off the charts! Everything that we tried on the menu was top notch. Also, not a huge sashimi guy but this place was the best I have ever had. It is a must try, and I know it is a bit pricey so wait until restaurant week if you would like an give it a try.

This was a great first pick for restaurant week. Just by looking at the menu, I was drooling. My friend and I got excited and even opted to do the wine pairing with the three courses. We also had similar tastes so decided to each pick different items for the courses so we could have a taste of everything:

First course- the sashimi was delightful. Nice thick cuts and good quality. The seared salmon maki was also delicious! Great start to the meal.

Second course- we ordered the cod and the steak. The cod was super tender- amazing! The brussel sprouts that came with the second course was probably my favorite though. These crispy brussel sprouts were probably the best I've had. Super flavorful. The steak was decent too.

Dessert time! The purple potato pudding was actually really tasty. I love this potato (a Japanese sweet potato) normally by itself so it was interesting how they made it into a dessert. The chocolate cake was also heavenly. 

All the wine pairings were perfect and tasty. My only complaint is that the service was soooo rushed! They were definitely in a hurry to get us out of there, which I didn't appreciate much. Other than this though it was an exceptional meal at roka!

Parking: street parking is hard but look around neighboring blocks

Ambience: The place is beautiful, you're greeted with the purple lighted bar. The restaurant's vibe is trendy and cool. 

Service: we had a table of 9 and it was a friend's birthday so service was excellent! We had complimentary glass of champagne and complimentary appetizer (cracker with some crab meat?) thanks to the chef. The waiter was patient as we looked over the menu for food and drinks. I appreciated that he gave us good recommendations as I liked some of the food that he recommended. 

Food: If you want authentic Japanese food, this is not the place to go. I felt that the food was very expensive for the quality of food. After trying the food, I felt like they served the food because it's "trendy," not for its authenticity. Each sushi roll came with 8 pieces and the prices ranged between $13-$22. Since we were a large group, we ate the sushi rolls family style and ordered double orders of the Hamachi Serrano Chili ($13), Salmon and Avocado ($12), Soft Shell Crab ($14), Crispy Unagi & Avocado ($18), Dynamite Scallop ($18), Seared Salmon Maki ($22), California ($13), and Spicy Tuna ($12). Of all of these rolls, the ones that stood out were the Hamachi Serrano Chili, Crispy Unagi & Avocado, and the Dynamite Scallop being my highlight of the meal. The rest of the sushi was okay in terms of flavor and quality of sushi. The serving sizes were small and I don't think my party was full even after ordering all those rolls. 

As for the dessert, I ordered the Green Tea Custard ($10), which had a foam/whipped cream on top of the green tea custard with caramelized bananas. I liked the whipped cream thing but once I got to the bottom of the jar, there was way too much green tea in the custard which didn't taste very pleasant. The mushy bananas did not help with the taste or texture, which threw me off. I appreciated that they gave my friend a free dessert for his birthday. He got some taro-flavored custard with fresh fruits on top, which was way better than my dessert.

Drinks: They had a ton of choices for alcoholic beverages like sake, cocktails, beer, wine, etc. I decided to get the Better Together cocktail, which had rum and ginger beer in it. It looked yummy and like a Mai Tai but I didn't like the taste. The ginger beer was overpowering and there wasn't as much rum as I'd liked. I switched with my friend who ordered some drink with Japanese whisky which was sweeter than I thought but it was yummy.

Verdict: I don't think I'll be coming back here for dinner. There's a ton of AYCE sushi buffets in the city that serve higher quality sushi for a lower price. However, I'm still willing to come back to try their happy hour during the week for cheap $5 appetizers and drinks. That is such a good deal compared to our expensive dinner which totaled to $40 per person so $300-$400 split among 9 people.

I have always loved Roka. I've been coming here from time to time for the past six years. Service is always excellent. Cocktails are on point. Quality of food has never disappointed. Atmosphere is lively, yet intimate. I'm not screaming for my company to hear me, nor am I concerned about the people a table over hearing my life story. It's a chill and unwind spot for me. I recommend making reservations, period. Great happy hour menu weekdays 5pm-6pm (lounge and patio only).

The corn small dish was delicious (whatever butter they use could be put on anything and make it taste good!) 

Looking forward to going back for a full dinner.

Been here twice and had an amazing experience both times. Service is so amazing, probably the best service I've seen (so far). Even bus persons have so much etiquette and manners. 

Food quality is really up there. But not a place to have a full meal. A place to experience good, high quality sushi and Japanese cuisine. 

It's in the city, surrounded by a lot of amazing restaurants, and this is one of the best sushi places I've been to so far.

Roka Akor truly cares about ensuring that their diners have a great experience. The manager and regional manager (Ben and Steve, respectively) wanted to make sure that I also had a wonderful experience. They put together a menu of their favorite items and as a result, I had the opportunity to try some new dishes.

My favorite dish of the night would probably have to be the nigiri flight. It was beautifully presented and the fish was fresh. I would have to say that the Prime Filet tasted much better than the Prime Rib Eye I had the first time I came here. It was much more tender and closer to that "medium rare" texture that I had expected. I noticed that several of the side dishes--the Shishito Peppers and Brussels Sprouts in particular--left a rather sour aftertaste that I was not fond of so I will most likely refrain from ordering them again in the future. I will also say that although I am not much of an oyster person, the oysters we were served were exceptionally fresh and briny, a flavor which I appreciated greatly.

Ben and Steve made my second experience at Roka Akor much more enjoyable. Thanks again for a great night!

I've been to Roka twice and thoroughly enjoyed it both times. The menu is intimidating but it's hard to go wrong. Most of the items are designed to be shared and the whole concept works well. Not to write off the steak, seafood, sushi, sashimi, or other dishes, but you're missing out if you don't order the Korean Spiced Lamb. 

When you make a reservation, specify that you want to sit in the main dining room. The bar seating arrangements (for three, at least) are too casual and the tables too small to enjoy a serious meal.

That thing had a kick to it with the spicy chili salted rim. The bartender was awesome! Think his name is George? Wish I would of gotten photos but I was too into the vibe of it all that I didn't want to run it by taking my phone out. Also, loved that they had football on! Lol

Slid in here late one night after having the chance to see Hamilton.  Glad they were open until midnight.  We were impressed with the service even though we were in late and it was getting close to closing time.  Staff was very friendly and helpful even though you know they probably wanted to break things down and get home.

We ordered quickly - red miso soup, robata grilled scallops, some tempura, marinated black cod, and a bunch of nigiri.  Personally, I love it when sushi places have a Tsukiji menu or a menu of stuff not typically found on the standard menu (sorry - tuna, salmon and shrimp get boring and I'm generally not a fan of most over sauced maki), but it didn't look like Roka Akor had something like that.  That being said - I would say that this place was pretty solid and is definitely a great place to go for a sushi fix.

Booked a Reservation for my boyfriends birthday. Neither of us had ever been here. Great vibe and decor in the restaurant. We had a great waitress and we found the food to be so delicious! It is very pricey, but some items are definitely worth it!

What we ordered and highlights- 
Butterfish Tataki- one of the most delicious things I've ever had. It's a must!
Beef and Kimchi dumplings- Delicious
Steak Tartare- Good, but I've had better
We ordered the chef's selection of 5 sashimi pieces- The fish was melt in your mouth good! Next time we think we will just order salmon/tuna as those were our favorites.
We ordered 2 sushi rolls, spicy tuna and dynamite scallop.
The spicy tuna could be skipped however the dynamite scallop- i've never tasted anything like it. It was unbelievably good!!

We also ordered the lamb cutlets which were good but I would probably skip next time, however my boyfriend really enjoyed them.

We had a great waitress but felt that the meal was a bit rushed. We would've liked to have had a slower experience. We will hopefully be back soon though! Thank you!

I've been to Roka Akor more times than I've checked-in but since most of the times I visit with clients, I forget to check-in on Yelp. While most of my experiences should be rated three stras this time around it was a solid four to 4 1/2 star experience.  

My amazing experience started with our waitress but regrettably I didn't get her name. Besides being attentive, she was very knowledgeable of the menu and was able to direct us accordingly. I delegated the ordering to my business partner so I can't describe all the rolls we ordered.  I do however, remember two dishes in particular that stood-out: wagyu beef rolls and New Zealand salmon sashimi. This was the absolutely the best salmon sashimi that I've ever had--and I've had a lot. 

Our numerous rolls and sashimi left no room for dessert but we're most certainly going to return.

One of my favorite places at the moment. I am a standard issue Irishman so bring me a fork and a bunch of grilled meat. I really enjoy their ribeye and skirt steak, make sure to get whatever the skirt steak sauce is with whatever steak you get, it's their best sauce. Kimchi dumplings are awesome, my guests really enjoy the sushi and seafood dishes. This place a hidden gem at lunch, get a bento box in a hurry and on the cheaper side for a high quality lunch in the city.

I came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend on Saturday night. I've been dying to try this place so I'm really glad we went. We started with different cocktails - I got a mule and he got The Usual Suspects. We ordered a variety of dishes - started with edamame, Wagyu Beef and Kimchi Dumplings, and some white fish dish that I don't remember but our waiter had recommended. We then ordered the ribeye & the teryiaki salmon which was honestly one of the best I've ever had. We took our time and definitely could have ordered more dishes but were pretty satisfied after my birthday dessert came (some special Japanese purple dessert) which was fantastic as well. Great meal, great atmosphere & will be back!

Wish I would of gotten photos but I was too into the vibe of it all that I didn't want to run it by taking my phone out. Also, loved that they had football on! Lol

The atmosphere is awesome.

Slid in here late one night after having the chance to see Hamilton.  Glad they were open until midnight.  We were impressed with the service even though we were in late and it was getting close to closing time.  Staff was very friendly and helpful even though you know they probably wanted to break things down and get home.

We ordered quickly - red miso soup, robata grilled scallops, some tempura, marinated black cod, and a bunch of nigiri.  Personally, I love it when sushi places have a Tsukiji menu or a menu of stuff not typically found on the standard menu (sorry - tuna, salmon and shrimp get boring and I'm generally not a fan of most over sauced maki), but it didn't look like Roka Akor had something like that.  That being said - I would say that this place was pretty solid and is definitely a great place to go for a sushi fix.

Booked a Reservation for my boyfriends birthday. Neither of us had ever been here. Great vibe and decor in the restaurant. We had a great waitress and we found the food to be so delicious! It is very pricey, but some items are definitely worth it!

What we ordered and highlights- 
Butterfish Tataki- one of the most delicious things I've ever had. It's a must!
Beef and Kimchi dumplings- Delicious
Steak Tartare- Good, but I've had better
We ordered the chef's selection of 5 sashimi pieces- The fish was melt in your mouth good! Next time we think we will just order salmon/tuna as those were our favorites.
We ordered 2 sushi rolls, spicy tuna and dynamite scallop.
The spicy tuna could be skipped however the dynamite scallop- i've never tasted anything like it. It was unbelievably good!!

We also ordered the lamb cutlets which were good but I would probably skip next time, however my boyfriend really enjoyed them.

We had a great waitress but felt that the meal was a bit rushed. We would've liked to have had a slower experience. We will hopefully be back soon though! Thank you!

I've been to Roka Akor more times than I've checked-in but since most of the times I visit with clients, I forget to check-in on Yelp. While most of my experiences should be rated three stras this time around it was a solid four to 4 1/2 star experience.  

My amazing experience started with our waitress but regrettably I didn't get her name. Besides being attentive, she was very knowledgeable of the menu and was able to direct us accordingly. I delegated the ordering to my business partner so I can't describe all the rolls we ordered.  I do however, remember two dishes in particular that stood-out: wagyu beef rolls and New Zealand salmon sashimi. This was the absolutely the best salmon sashimi that I've ever had--and I've had a lot. 

Our numerous rolls and sashimi left no room for dessert but we're most certainly going to return.

One of my favorite places at the moment. I am a standard issue Irishman so bring me a fork and a bunch of grilled meat. I really enjoy their ribeye and skirt steak, make sure to get whatever the skirt steak sauce is with whatever steak you get, it's their best sauce. Kimchi dumplings are awesome, my guests really enjoy the sushi and seafood dishes. This place a hidden gem at lunch, get a bento box in a hurry and on the cheaper side for a high quality lunch in the city.

I came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend on Saturday night. I've been dying to try this place so I'm really glad we went. We started with different cocktails - I got a mule and he got The Usual Suspects. We ordered a variety of dishes - started with edamame, Wagyu Beef and Kimchi Dumplings, and some white fish dish that I don't remember but our waiter had recommended. We then ordered the ribeye & the teryiaki salmon which was honestly one of the best I've ever had. We took our time and definitely could have ordered more dishes but were pretty satisfied after my birthday dessert came (some special Japanese purple dessert) which was fantastic as well. Great meal, great atmosphere & will be back!

The food, service, and ambiance are all on point. We sat in the lounge area by the front of the restaurant, which had adequate seating on a Saturday night around 8:00pm. I didn't get to go to the back of the restaurant, but it seemed to be a pretty spacious restaurant.

There's outdoor seating, a lounge area to the left of the entrance, and main dining area in the back. I love how the bar has a wrap-around shelf with drinks inside as well as the wooden decor. It definitely gives off a trendy, modern vibe. You know those restaurants or lounges where the music is so loud that you have to shout at each other until your throat hurts? Not here! You can have a normal conversation yet can still hear the music if you focus on it.

We ordered the following off the menu:
- Toro tartare: Served cold with ossetra caviar, quail egg, and taro crisp. I'm always skeptical about anything raw, but this was delicious and definitely tasted fresh. You're supposed to spoon a bit of the toro tartare onto the taro crisp and eat the whole thing. The taro crisp wasn't overly salty by any means so it didn't overpower the flavor of the toro tartare.
- Crispy squid: This was my favorite dish. It has chili flavoring, and you squeeze the lime over the squid. It was served with a sauce on the side. All the flavors just worked well with each other. Yum!
- Shrimp and lobster dumplings: This definitely had a unique flavor, in a positive way. I can't quite put my finger on what it is, but this was pretty tasty.
We also sampled some of Rich's (the GM) creations, which were fantastic.

If you come here starving, it will be quite an expensive meal. If my friend wasn't there, I would most certainly eat everything we had in a heartbeat and then some. However, I demonstrated self control and avoided looking like I hadn't eaten for days.

Service was impeccable. Rich made sure we were taken care of and was awesome blossom. Our server was friendly and attentive as well.

I definitely recommend checking this restaurant out when you're in the mood for a fancy place. I'll definitely come back to try the sushi or happy hour next time.

Ambiance: bit touristy 3 stars
Food: decent but not worth the price 2.5 stars

We looked up "best sushi in Chicago" and Trip Advisor failed us once again and this place came up as #1. 

Let's start with the short comings. Abalone was 4 slim 2cm by 2cm by 2mm slices of rubbery abalone for $15. This sets the tone of the rest of the meal. The mussels was way way over cooked and this dry. Had to soak it in its broth (although decent flavor) to rehydrate. I would recommend the line cook in charge of this station to take a trip to Publican to see how it should be prepared- night and day.

Lobster tempura was ok, bit heavy on the batter- the 2 sauce that came with the dish was pleasant. Ribeye was cooked well but on the chewy side. The sushi rolls were good but had much better. Best thing here may be the dessert- taro custard was really good and the different flavors of sherbet was creative. 

All in all, this is by far not the best sushi place in Chicago. I would not even rank it in top 15. $300 meal that was far from memorable, I would rate this place as average at best.

Great oyster special with signature oyster dressing.

OYSTERS: I ordered the bluepoints (with shallot dressing), which were on special. And I ordered a half dozen of the chino oysters from VA (with garlic ponzu). 

The Chino oysters were very good. The garlic ponzu dressing must have made these babies, because I think I'll be dreaming of them for a while. A chewy oyster with a crisp finish. 

The Blue points were bland as an oyster, but the shallot dressing certainly elevated their creaminess.   Weird, because I never find bluepoints to be creamy at all. The dressing was a little vinegar And maybe a little bit too salty. But I enjoy living life on the edge with high blood pressure. So it worked for me. 

I like places that can put their own spin on oyster condiments, so this place moved to the top of my list as an oyster special place. Also the oysters were well shucked, and the oyster yield included the connective tissue, which I love. So yay! 

DRINK: I ordered the Kobayashi Issa, which tasted like a lighter, crisper version of an old fashion. Certainly some citrusy undertones in the drink. And the base flavors very characteristic of Japanese whiskey, full but lacking smoke. The drink had what appeared to be a hand-chipped ice cube. Great for not watering down the drink. 

Certainly a boozy drink. I started to feel it 2/3 of the way through. That, I appreciate.

SERVICE: They accidentally dropped off a singular oyster in front of me that was for another person. I thought it was a tester, for me to order some of those In addition to the oysters I had ordered. I did enjoy it, so I ordered a half dozen. 

As an apology for delivering the wrong order, they comped me an order of wagyu beef potstickers, which were delicious with a great kick. I like when establishments can admit a fumble and make up for it. That, to me, speaks to a dedication to customer service

The bartender was absolutely adorable. Very high energy and great timing in terms of knowing when to check in and when not to bother because I'm scrolling through Instagram.

In CONCLUSION: Great oyster happy hour. Between here, Union sushi, and Tortoise club, I think I found my oyster trinity.

It's really tough to find upscale Japanese places that are top-quality in Chicago. This place definitely comes close. It has the ambience and the location, but some of the food is just not hitting the mark. 

The only thing that is a must order is the Japanese Wild Mushroom Rice Hot Pot. So so so good. Other than that, the sushi is just okay. And the other hot entrees were not super impressive.

I had been to Roka a couple years ago and the melt in your mouth toro and wagyu were enough for me to take my boyfriend there to celebrate his new job. It was really a flawless experience. The tomatoes burst in your mouth, vegetables were perfectly cooked with lots of flavor, sushi cut in front of us with delicate sashimi, and the desserts had flair. The chocolate cake was molten and the yuzu sorbet was tangy inside a crisp white chocolate shell complemented with fresh fruit. Go check it out - you won't be disappointed! :) 

My boyfriend's account (and he is not someone who normally spends time writing about food):
Everything at Roka Akor was perfect. We sat at the sushi bar and had a great show seeing all the chefs make spectacular sushi arrangements and cook beef on their wood-fire stove. The service had good pacing, and all the food was delicious -- from the sushi to the desserts. Who knew a sushi place had such good cake?

We just went to Roka to get a quick glass of wine after work, ordered a Sauvignon Blanc and it was warm so we asked if we could have a cold glass. The waitress was less than friendly. I just so happened to look back at the bar, saw the bartender pour all of our glasses that we had sipped into a big carafe, put it in the refrigerator, pulled it out and re-poured all of our sipped wines. When we called them out for doing it, they flat out denied it, though we saw it with our own eyes. I am absolutely repulsed.

The best thing here was the brussel sprouts and they were a solid 3/5. I would avoid like the bubonic plague. Ordered a yellowtail sashimi and the quality was subpar. I cannot believe this place has such great reviews.

Service was also extremely inattentive. I had to flag down a different server to ask for the check, TWICE. Not once did someone ask how our meal was going. They forgot to bring some items we ordered so when we asked for the check we told them so they could remove it. The server, verbatim said, "i can bring it out now because it's easier than to remove it from the bill." I worked as a server for years, this is .. the first time I've ever heard this.

Anyway, if you do go here, get the brussel sprouts. If you're on the fence, there are so many delicious restaurants in Chicago don't waste your money here.

Wow. Finally got to try Roka Akor thanks to Restaurant Week! I was so excited about the meal that I essentially memorized the menu and knew exactly what I would be ordering before I even stepped in the restaurant. My friend and I tried the flame-seared salmon maki, the Wagyu sirloin, and the ume pot de creme. 

YUM! The maki was fresh and the flame sear on the salmon gave the fish a deep, complex taste. 

Next came the sirloin--I got mine medium rare--with a deliciously light dipping sauce and mushrooms. The sirloin melted in my mouth, and paired well with the chewiness of the mushrooms. Probably the best steak I've ever had (though I don't eat that much steak in general...) 

Finally, the pot de creme. Hands down one of the best desserts I've ever had. It was thick, beautifully purple, served with fresh berries and kiwi, and mildly sweet. Though I have a sweet tooth, I can often feel overwhelmed by creamy desserts, and this dessert had me wanting about 3 others. 

Overall, a great meal in a modern Japanese restaurant, with great service.

If you're willing to drop around $50 per person, then this place is definitely worth it. The Waygu Beef Dumplings were amazing, so was there take on fried calamari. As tempting as it is to only get sushi at a Japanese restaurant, definitely try out one of their steaks (I got the ribeye). The brussel sprouts are also extremely tasty.

There likely are not enough superlatives to describe the experience enjoyed by my wife and me.

From the moment we entered, until the time we left, every interaction with the staff was top-notch.

The service is attentive without being overly so, and the servers are not only knowledgeable, but helpful with suggestions and recommendations.

Which brings me to our dining selections: the seasonal vegetables with prawns and butterfish tempura, Dynamite Scallop, Tiger Prawn, and the 12 oz. Prime Rib Eye were all done to near perfection. Since we were celebrating our 18th wedding anniversary (a miracle in and of itself) and were treated to simply THE MOST AWESOME DESSERT imaginable - the Yuzu Semifreddo maybe - it was simply phenomenal.

What I love about this place:

-Chop sticks only - no flatware
-Japanese Wild Mushroom Rice Hot Pot (a must with your meal)
-Everything is prepared so that it can be easily shared

Count me among those who eat their words about what they will never do.

I will be back - and bringing friends with me!

Average food and service. I expect more for this price point.  All of the food was good it just wasn't great. The yellowtail sashimi was bland, the tuna was good but not memorable.  The wagyu and kimchi dumplings really good though. The filet was good but not a great steak. Def not a $50 steak. The sushi was above average. All of the sides we had were very good.  The waiter was overly obnoxious.  He asked if we had been there before, when we indicated we had not he treated us like we had never eaten at a restaurant before.  He was very preachy and condescending. He just tried too hard to sound important.  Maybe that is just River North. Overall had nice Japanese flavors but if you want a great steak stick with RPM, Bavettes, etc.

Went here for Tuesday happy hour from 5-6pm. Showed up with a group of 12 people after work without a reservation, and they were able to accommodate us well in the bar area. Drinks off happy hour menu are around $5 and good. I also got the Hamachi Serrano Roll for $6 during HH, and it was good but only came with 5 pieces. Basically the happy hour isn't as great of a deal as you would think because you're almost required to order multiple dishes with the small portions. I also ordered the wagyu beef and kimchi dumplings. Definitely tasted great but also only came with 3 dumplings. I was able to order one oyster for $1, which is their Tuesday special. Overall pricing is a bit expensive for what you actually get despite food actually tasting good. 

In terms of service, we had a few slight issues. A large tray of oysters was brought to our table mistakenly which we did not order. The waitress saw this and said we could go ahead and take them since they were brought to us. Thirty seconds later the man who originally brought them said sorry and grabbed them off our table to deliver them to the rightful owner. This was awkward. The orders were also not put in entirely correct, so one of my friends was missing her dumplings while the rest of us had already finished all of our food. In the end, it was brought out when we were all ready to leave, so she just had them boxed, and they were taken off our bill thankfully.

Very expensive, very sleek and a fabulous place to hold a private dinner.  Their function space is minimalist but that is perfectly fine because the emphasis should be on their incredible food and incredible it is!  They have several options for you to choose from and range from under $70 per person to over $200 pre tax and tip.  Splurge here, your guests whether they are clients or friends will love you for it. 

It is part of a chain, but do no let that deter you from this place.  Seriously.

Service is impeccable.  Five stars for sure.

The server, verbatim said, "i can bring it out now because it's easier than to remove it from the bill." I worked as a server for years, this is .. the first time I've ever heard this.

Anyway, if you do go here, get the brussel sprouts. If you're on the fence, there are so many delicious restaurants in Chicago don't waste your money here.

Wow. Finally got to try Roka Akor thanks to Restaurant Week! I was so excited about the meal that I essentially memorized the menu and knew exactly what I would be ordering before I even stepped in the restaurant. My friend and I tried the flame-seared salmon maki, the Wagyu sirloin, and the ume pot de creme. 

YUM! The maki was fresh and the flame sear on the salmon gave the fish a deep, complex taste. 

Next came the sirloin--I got mine medium rare--with a deliciously light dipping sauce and mushrooms. The sirloin melted in my mouth, and paired well with the chewiness of the mushrooms. Probably the best steak I've ever had (though I don't eat that much steak in general...) 

Finally, the pot de creme. Hands down one of the best desserts I've ever had. It was thick, beautifully purple, served with fresh berries and kiwi, and mildly sweet. Though I have a sweet tooth, I can often feel overwhelmed by creamy desserts, and this dessert had me wanting about 3 others. 

Overall, a great meal in a modern Japanese restaurant, with great service.

If you're willing to drop around $50 per person, then this place is definitely worth it. The Waygu Beef Dumplings were amazing, so was there take on fried calamari. As tempting as it is to only get sushi at a Japanese restaurant, definitely try out one of their steaks (I got the ribeye). The brussel sprouts are also extremely tasty.

The environment was really nice and classy. I had their sushi and it was pretty good. I wouldn't say the best sushi I've had but good. The fish was fresh and they didn't skimp on the fish. I had their spicy tuna, avocado salmon rolls, tuna 4 ways. I liked the tuna 4 ways and avocado salmon rolls the best.

There likely are not enough superlatives to describe the experience enjoyed by my wife and me.

From the moment we entered, until the time we left, every interaction with the staff was top-notch.

The service is attentive without being overly so, and the servers are not only knowledgeable, but helpful with suggestions and recommendations.

Which brings me to our dining selections: the seasonal vegetables with prawns and butterfish tempura, Dynamite Scallop, Tiger Prawn, and the 12 oz. Prime Rib Eye were all done to near perfection. Since we were celebrating our 18th wedding anniversary (a miracle in and of itself) and were treated to simply THE MOST AWESOME DESSERT imaginable - the Yuzu Semifreddo maybe - it was simply phenomenal.

What I love about this place:

-Chop sticks only - no flatware
-Japanese Wild Mushroom Rice Hot Pot (a must with your meal)
-Everything is prepared so that it can be easily shared

Count me among those who eat their words about what they will never do.

I will be back - and bringing friends with me!

Average food and service. I expect more for this price point.  All of the food was good it just wasn't great. The yellowtail sashimi was bland, the tuna was good but not memorable.  The wagyu and kimchi dumplings really good though. The filet was good but not a great steak. Def not a $50 steak. The sushi was above average. All of the sides we had were very good.  The waiter was overly obnoxious.  He asked if we had been there before, when we indicated we had not he treated us like we had never eaten at a restaurant before.  He was very preachy and condescending. He just tried too hard to sound important.  Maybe that is just River North. Overall had nice Japanese flavors but if you want a great steak stick with RPM, Bavettes, etc.

Went here for Tuesday happy hour from 5-6pm. Showed up with a group of 12 people after work without a reservation, and they were able to accommodate us well in the bar area. Drinks off happy hour menu are around $5 and good. I also got the Hamachi Serrano Roll for $6 during HH, and it was good but only came with 5 pieces. Basically the happy hour isn't as great of a deal as you would think because you're almost required to order multiple dishes with the small portions. I also ordered the wagyu beef and kimchi dumplings. Definitely tasted great but also only came with 3 dumplings. I was able to order one oyster for $1, which is their Tuesday special. Overall pricing is a bit expensive for what you actually get despite food actually tasting good. 

In terms of service, we had a few slight issues. A large tray of oysters was brought to our table mistakenly which we did not order. The waitress saw this and said we could go ahead and take them since they were brought to us. Thirty seconds later the man who originally brought them said sorry and grabbed them off our table to deliver them to the rightful owner. This was awkward. The orders were also not put in entirely correct, so one of my friends was missing her dumplings while the rest of us had already finished all of our food. In the end, it was brought out when we were all ready to leave, so she just had them boxed, and they were taken off our bill thankfully.

Very expensive, very sleek and a fabulous place to hold a private dinner.  Their function space is minimalist but that is perfectly fine because the emphasis should be on their incredible food and incredible it is!  They have several options for you to choose from and range from under $70 per person to over $200 pre tax and tip.  Splurge here, your guests whether they are clients or friends will love you for it. 

It is part of a chain, but do no let that deter you from this place.  Seriously.

Service is impeccable.  Five stars for sure.

I can't say enough good things about Roka Akor. From the friendly hostesses, to our very knowledgeable and kind waiter, the experience was really wonderful. We went to celebrate my boyfriend passing the Bar so I had asked that there be a celebratory dessert of some sort. Not only did we get a dessert that said congratulations on it, they had champagne for us when we sat down and several people on their staff congratulated my boyfriend who didn't even know us. They knew he passed the bar and took the time to come over and say something nice. The food was also delicious. Their beef dumplings, which is a signature dish of theirs, were so good we almost got a second order. Their sushi was also very fresh and presented nicely. The scallop roll sounded too good not to try, and it didn't disappoint. I would recommend Roka Akor to anyone who is looking for a nice restaurant, to celebrate an occasion, and to have really delicious sushi.

Went here for a birthday dinner. Had the shrimp and lobster dumplings which were yum! Blend of different flavors. Husband had the yuzu miso marinated black cod which was as soft as butter melting in your mouth. I had the prime rib eye which was excellent, flavor in every bite. I got the wazu sauce but also requested the chili ginger sauce from the filet which made it even more tasty! For dessert tried they warm choloclate cake and they gave us a complimentary Yuzu semifreddo as a birthday treat, fruity and delicious! The prime rib eye was halal is anyone is interested in knowing. Will be coming back for more!

This is my second time dining at Roka Akor. Having visited the one in Scottsdale, I knew I had to visit this place again. I've always found it pretty hard to find good sushi / japanese steakhouses that meet my expectations (perhaps I'm a bit of a sushi snob..) so needless to say, I was very excited when I heard that we'd be celebrating my birthday dinner here at RA in Chicago.

At the restaurant, we went for the Decadent Omakase because we wanted the sushi chefs to surprise us with the best that they've got. The omakase that night comprised of beef tatare, rohan duck carpaccio and robata grilled scallops to start, followed by (in order) an assortment of sashimi, nigiri, a whole lobster tempura (with spicy ponzu and wasabi aioli), chilean sea bass, asparagus, crispy brussel sprouts, A5 wagyu and japanese wild mushroom rice hot pot. The dessert platter is of course, unique to Roka Akor. It was a creative and beautiful ensemble with yummy sorbets and ice-creams, warm chocolate cake, fruit and a blueberry custard which never disappoints!

Overall, it was an extremely satisfying and delicious meal. We were pleased that we got to try most of their signature dishes and I would pick no better restaurant to end off my night on a happier note!

I had the whitefish appetizer which was very good, the tuna tartare which was underwhelming and the vegetable tempura which was a good value at $9.  The restaurant tries to be a high end Japanese restaurant but falls slightly short of that.  Staff was friendly and restaurant modern and clean.  Wanted to love it but can't say that I did.

We sat at the high top table in the bar area which was a little cramped for getting up to use the restroom. Service was great. Janelle was really helpful and fun.

The delectable dishes we all recommended by their staff and are all hand made from scratch by their highly intuitive chef that has knowledge of true Japanese cuisine. Something as simple as miso soup, a soup meant for purely filling the stomach, had lemon twist and flavors that really scaled the whole culture inside of a bowl. Pure art and craftsmanship.

We had a perfect meal! We've been here before and meals we're very good, but tonight the choices were terrific. Casey highlighted some of the menu changes and had some great suggestions. We started with the edamame which had just the right amount of sea salt. We always order the Brussels sprouts which are grilled with wafu, mustard and bonito flakes. They had a robata grilled short rib special that melted in our mouths and was so good we ordered another and rice to mix with the broth. The wagyu maki was another high point. It was steak tartare in a unique presentation. 
We moved to dessert and the melted chocolate cake is always good but they also had a fruit based tiramisu which was refreshing and light.

I had a positive experience with this restaurant other than with the host. We arrived for a birthday dinner a little bit late, admittedly. Approximately 7 minutes late, which I would imagine happens pretty frequently in Chicago with varying degrees of traffic. We were half the party and the other half the party was meeting us there. The host was very rude. He asked the other hostess, right in front of us, "who makes a reservation for ten people and then shows up late?" It was offensive. 

Following our interaction with him, we were seated at our table and had a very nice server who was accommodating to our group and was able to split the check a couple of ways without complaint. I tried several sushi rolls, including lobster, wagyu beef and the dynamite scallop roll. All were excellent, though the scallop roll was my favorite. My drink was $13 but pretty strong.

I would return here, though I would expect considerably better service from the host. Speaking badly about your customers, who could have eaten literally anywhere else in Chicago, in front of their faces, is unacceptable.

Came here for dinner and ordered all the Roka favorites including the Wagyu A5 beef, cod, sashimi, mushroom rice, scallops and escolar tataki.  Overall the food was good.

Negatives were the place was too loud, and I was confused as to why sake was served in wine glasses.  My friend ordered a cappuccino and our waiter said they couldn't make it but he would try.  He came back with cappuccinos that were lukewarm and later brought complimentary hot ones to replace it.  

Overall an a-ok experience.  Glad I tried it but not sure I'd go out of my way to go back.

I had high expectations for this place considering its rating. Went in for lunch today and sat outside. Took a while for the waitress to finally come to our table. Ordered some bento boxes and when the food came out, it was never explained to us that it didn't come in a box and it's all separate items so we were confused on who's food was who's. Waitress only came back 2 times total. Maybe it's because we sat outside? Not sure. I would try this place again and get something different and probably sit inside.

Amazing food, some of the best food/ sushi in chicago. Everything is very fresh and delicate but still has so much flavor. Very cool decor and atmosphere. The bar staff and hosts were great, we moved a few times when we were sat because the table was just too small and cramped and they gracefully moved us. The only issue was our server seemed rushed and we wanted to enjoy the experience a little more. We are originally from chicago and moved out of state and wanted to enjoy our time with old friends and we felt we were being rushed to order or pressured to say we were done or not done. So besides that we had an amazing experience. Would go back would just ask for a certain server or sit in the lounge area where it's more low key.

The food here was truly amazing! We dined here for a special occasion and tried the Omakase. I have tried chefs' tables and at least a half dozen other omakase type experiences since, but so far nothing has been able to top Roka Akor. Every single dish we had was phenomenal! My  absolute favorite was the cod. You will not be able to find anything like it anywhere else. It literally just melts in your mouth. The presentation for each dish was beautiful. You can tell that they put a lot of time and effort into the presentation. The service we received was also impeccable. 

This was not the cheapest experience, however, it was worth every dime. I am definitely going to return again.

Roka Akor... is hands down a must go-to when in Chicago. 

The service is AMAZING - The servers know A LOT I can always ask them about certain dishes and they know everything about it and can recommend things that I would really like. Not to mention the managers. The managers are always coming up to my table and tables around me introducing themselves and making sure everything is perfect, definitely not a snobby River North attitude that I see other places. 

The food.... omg the FOOD!! You actually could order anything on the menu and it would be delicious. I have had a decent amount of the menu and everything is prepared perfectly. Each course has so many different and complex flavors. Not to mention any steak you order is cooked PERFECTLY. 

I recommend Brussel Sprouts (I don't even like brusselsprouts till but I love these), Scallops, Crispy Squid, Wagyu Beef and Kimchi Dumplings, Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll, Dynamite Scallop Roll, Crispy Prawn and Chirashi Roll, their Filet, and their Skirt Steak! 

All delishh!

I recommend Brussel Sprouts (I don't even like brusselsprouts till but I love these), Scallops, Crispy Squid, Wagyu Beef and Kimchi Dumplings, Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll, Dynamite Scallop Roll, Crispy Prawn and Chirashi Roll, their Filet, and their Skirt Steak! 

All delishh!

My wife and i celebrated our 10 year anniversary here and could not have experienced a better meal.  The ambiance, the service and most importantly the meal was extremely delicious.  We first started to think about which entrees to eat but our server David, who by the way was legit, suggested we go for the Omakase menu that was about 100 bucks per person, since we wanted to try a bit of everything and go yolo.

Every single dish we received was catered to our needs, we had some dietary restrictions (no pork) and they did a good job serving up all the meals with that attention to detail.  The sashimi cuts and fish items were as fresh as I could imagine outside the Tsujiki Fish Market in Tokyo.

The prime beef was deliciously made on a robata grill and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  

The dessert platter was amazing with one of the most delicious molten chocolate cakes I have tried to date!  

Very impressed and I cannot wait to go back again!

I hate sushi BUT I really liked this place! There were more options for non sushi eaters like myself on the menu. I had the baked chicken with mushrooms which was fantastic! It came chopped up like little sushi rolls so I was able to eat it with my chopsticks. I felt like I was still participating with the sushi fun even though it wasn't my thing. The steak also came chopped up in a similar style. The shrimp bites were great and I loved my cocktails. This would be one sushi spot I would return to.

This place is a full on tourist trap. 

Pretty exterior, and crappy food. 

Beverage items are disgustingly Overpriced and really don't deliver on quality. Who made these decisions?  

They need to find someone who knows what they are talking about. Manager presence non-existent. 

Take your money elsewhere. Unless you enjoy crappy overpriced tourist trap fare.

Got the omakase tonight $128 per person. Overall pretty happy with the food and you definitely get really full from the meal! The lobster tempura and the Brussel sprouts were not great but the other items were all pretty good. The sashimi course was a bit underwhelming, would have loved to see some toro and uni. The steak and truffle risotto were excellent! 

One thing we hated was that its LOUD in this restaurant. We were seated right underneath one of the many JBL speakers plus all neighboring tables were really loud too. Just hard to have a conversation. I know there are many locations across the country, maybe others would have a better ambiance.

My friend and I dined here last night. It took them a little while to come greet our table, but we were given a class of champagne and an apology. We shared edamame. It was delicious!!! She had a spicy California roll and vegetable tempura. Both were great. I had the crispy prawn roll and their special Kobe beef tartare. Both were great as well. Dinner was nice, calm, not super expensive. Overall, we both would go back.

I am sooooo impressed by this restaurant!!! This was one of the highlights of my recent foodcation. We ordered so much food.. to include steak and marrow, several orders of sushi (scallop, crab, etc.), crab rice pot, lobster dumplings, rock shrimp, squid, Brussels, and more! Everything was simply amazing! The ambiance, service, and food were A1!

After a 9 hour flight of hell I finally arrived in Chicago starving!!!  Unfortunately my friend forgot to make dinner reservation. So after 3 failed attempts to get a reservation, we finally got a table at Roka Akor.

The restaurant is so cool and modern, beautifully decorated. When you walk in there's a giant bar with seating to the left. To the right is the main dinning are with a huge sushi bar and various seating options.

We started off with some cocktails I'm a bubbly girl so I got the La Grande Dame which consisted of Hennessy VS Cognac, Black Tea, Lemon, House Made Yuzu Bitters, Mint, Mot & Chandon "Imprial" Brut.  Follow by Of Fruit & Fire which consisted of House Made Raspberry Puree, Agave, Lemon, Peychaud's Bitters, Charles De Fre "Cuve Jean-Louis" Blanc De Blancs both cocktails were delicious. 

For dinner we started with Butterfish Tataki and Wagyu Beef and Kimchi Dumpling appetizers. The butterfish melted on your tongue it was heavenly. The dumplings were pretty yummy as well.  For our main course my friend and I shared the Prime New York Strip Loin with Bone Marrow and 5 different kinds of Chef Selection Sashimi. The bone marrow was seasoned to perfection and the New York Strip was one of the best steaks I've ever hand. The sashimi was fresh and oh so delicious.  We ended this amazing meal with a Dessert Platter that consisted of warm chocolate cake, green tea custard and a selection of fruit and ice cream.

Overall one of the most amazing meals I've ever had. I won't lie our bill was pretty pricey but it was SO worth it.  A definite must try restaurant if you're ever in Chicago!!!

Absolutely a must try!! Modern, hip, and fresh. As you walk in you can't help but smile. With the cool wood finishes and modern design with neon lights the restaurant gives out a great experience.

The food is absolutely fresh. With a view of the sushi chef slicing away sashimi style cuts. The elegant kobi beef is cooked over fresh charcoal flames in house and one can hear the sizzle of the meat and the aroma of the charcoal. A work of culinary art.

The presentation is beautiful. Sashimi is placed on a bed of crush ice with lights and floral arrangements. A sure to make you say oooooh ahhhh

I always pass Roka Akor in the city and decided to finally try it out. The place has cool decor and the staff is extremely friendly. Definitely a cute place for a date or maybe a celebration dinner. 

I came for lunch and the waiter recommended a bento box. I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and my friend got the Maki set. The bento box style lunches all come with the Crispy Butterfish Maki, White Miso Soup and Wagyu Dumplings so you get to try a little bit of everything. The Crispy Butterfish Maki was nice and fresh but nothing special. The White Miso Soup was also pretty good and consisted of quality mushrooms. The Wagyu Dumplings were also good but a little salty. The Chicken Teriyaki was cooked perfectly and was really tender. 

The reason I would give this place a 3 star is because I didn't really care for the flavors. It was a bit too bland for me since I am a huge fan of flavor and spice. I will say the food there is excellent quality and the service is great as well as the ambiance. Unfortunately the food just didn't hit the spot for me.

Unreal amounts of deliciousness!!!!! I came here with a bunch of co workers on a recommendation from the hostess at my hotel and we really felt like we got the true Chicago foodie dining experience. 

We tried many dishes at our table but for me, the standout was the tartare with a quail egg and caviar. Perfection. Even though this place seems to be popular for their sushi, this is also a stellar place to order a steak. All steaks are grilled and cut before they are served making them easy to share and easy to eat with chopsticks. The presentation of each dish was beautiful to look at but even more beautiful to eat. 

Our waiter was professional and extremely knowledgeable and even gave us recommendations of where to hang out afterward.

Came here for sushi and regret that.  Should have went with a an entree from the grill.  Drinks were good.  Service very good.  Appetizers the best.  A bit odd on furniture - the tables are tiny and we were asked if we wanted to keep a menu and they leaned it upon the floor (...).  We eat out a lot - from dive bars, street stands, to Le Cirque - never have I seen such an inappropriate display.  Were I to return it would be for the appetizers and drinks.

So not the first time I've been here (by a long shot) but was just impressed by the restaurant week menu, which rarely ever happens.  I'm usually the one in the group to go off the prixe fixe because nothing there catches my eye and I'd rather pay a few extra bucks for what I want.  However this time around the menu looked great, the only questionable part was the complimentary cocktail which was fine but primarily fruit juice :)
On to the meal... Started with the yellowtail sashimi which was fresh with a delicious ponzu.  Chose the miso cod for entree and it was a generous portion, perfectly cooked, lightly sweet, yummy!  Had the chocolate cake for dessert (duh) and it was warm with ice cream, total no brainier... Overall solid win, no matter which menu you order off of :)

After an initially underwhelming experience here, I was forced into giving Roka Akor another chance with friends who wanted to dine here.  Roka has stepped up its game because I definitely wasn't underwhelmed this time.  One thing that has stayed consistent is the cool and trendy vibe of this chain.  I definitely felt a lot less like the exhausted mom I have been for the last 9 months and more like my pre-baby energetic self after stepping inside.  If that's not a miracle, then I don't know what is ;)!

We started with the Crab Rice Hot Pot with Wasabi Tobiko, Corn and Edamame.  The corn and the crab were a match made in heaven.  They were a great pairing and really made the dish so darn delicious.

Next, we had the Roasted Beet Salad with Jalapeno Miso Vinaigrette and Smoked Almonds.  Definitely a new take on the traditional beet salad and I must say that the smoked almonds and miso vinaigrette were spot on with the earthy flavor of the beets.

We decided to share the following:
1. Wagyu Beef and Kimchi Dumplings
2. Robata Grilled Japanese Shishito Peppers with Ponzu & Bonito Flakes
3. Shrimp and Lobster Dumplings
4. Rock Shrimp Tempura with Wasabi Peas and Sweet Chili Aioli
5. Spicy Fried Tofu with Avocado Relish, Fresno Chili

Everything was really delicious and we didn't feel experience buyers remorse on any of the items we chose.  Also, our server was fabulous.  Intuitively arriving when we needed something otherwise laying low to allow us to take all the time we needed because it was obvious my table was having a wonderful time.

I'm glad I was able to give this place a second chance because it is not in my nature to do so.  Maybe I need to revisit my stringent policy on no second chances!

I enjoyed eating here (I got the calamari, mushroom hot pot, and 3 type nigiri, plus The Usual Suspects cocktail and some house shochu). They also gave a nice complimentary salad. Everything had good ingredients, seemingly, and was good.

As much as I enjoyed it, it's not worth the price in my opinion. It's not that the food is bad at all, it's just that the price is really, really high, while not really being that spectacular.

If you're really curious about it, check it out. I would go back for the cocktails and shochu and maybe some appetizers. I want to also try the seared salmon but can't justify paying 18$ for it, especially as maki, they should consider selling it as sashimi.

I do quite like the wilmette location, which is more of a ramen place. It's pricy for ramen but I do think it's worthwhile every now and then. Whereas 24$ for 6 pieces of sushi is just too steep.

Still fabulous. I have been a total of 4 times incl once as part of an event.  It is one of my favorite restaurants. I would come more often if it were a little cheaper ;-)  I had a starter w white fish wrapped around asparagus, I dont remember the name of it... delicious. Seabass was delicious, the tiger prawn was also great. Sweet corn and brussel sprouts were so tasty. I tried a piece of my sisters sushi and loved it. Our server Anthony was wonderful and gave excellent recommendations. I totally LOVED the Mount Nelson Sauvignon Blanc he recommended.   I thought the chocolate cake was good, for my taste I like my chocolate less sweet, my sister thought it was just right.

UPDATED: June 2017

We were invited back by the manager and enjoyed probably one of best nights I've had in a long time. The drinks, the food, the staff were all really amazing. I had no idea what to expect going back and I'm so glad I did because, after our most recent experience, I would really recommend this restaurant to a friend. 

.
.
.

I've honestly never written a bad review before. I've had servers make mistakes and that's ok but this just seemed to be handled wrong and I left the restaurant feeling very upset. Here's what happened during our meal last night.

1. Our friends got our drinks and our server forgot mine and my husband's. She never checked to make sure we got our drinks and when I mentioned it she said oh I can get them I forgot. I said that's ok we are getting our food now I don't want it. I just don't want to be charged.

2. Now later, everyone has their food but me. I wait awhile because dishes come out at different times. Our server had told us this with the first round of dinner dishes. I  had ordered a sushi roll and our friend's had their sushi rolls but they were waiting for one more. So I thought, ok it's coming, then our server never came back. When everyone was done she came back and ask about dessert. I said I never got my food. She said oh do you want it?  What did you order? I told her and she said oh I forgot, I thought you had the side of sweet potato. I said no, that was my husband's to go with his steak. She said I can get you one? I said no, not now everyone is finished and ready to leave it's late. So she said ok, just the check then?

3. She brought the check and my friend said aren't you going to get a manager or something, my friend didn't get her drink or her food. Her husband didn't get his drink and you forgot a sushi roll. She was like oh ok yeah. Comes back and said we took $31.50 off the bill. No manager came. She did apologize a few times but it just felt insincere and it felt like this was handled the wrong way. I'm disappointed that a manager never came, he was walking around but it seemed like he didn't care to stop by.  I hate to complain but I've never had something happened like this before. I eat out a lot and this experience was really bad. I hope that a manager will contact me to resolve this. I have emailed the restaurant to let them know what happened.

Decent sushi place at River North. Our server was extremely friendly and helpful. He was able to communicate with the kitchen and add some special requests for our omakase order. I definitely recommend to go with omakase if this is your first time dining in. Everything we got was outstanding and we were so full that we couldn't finish our dessert. Sashimi platter was delicious. I absolutely love the lobster tempura and seared Sea Bass!!! The red snapper tataki and beef tataki were also pretty impressive.
We'll definitely come back.

2. Now later, everyone has their food but me. I wait awhile because dishes come out at different times. Our server had told us this with the first round of dinner dishes. I  had ordered a sushi roll and our friend's had their sushi rolls but they were waiting for one more. So I thought, ok it's coming, then our server never came back. When everyone was done she came back and ask about dessert. I said I never got my food. She said oh do you want it?  What did you order? I told her and she said oh I forgot, I thought you had the side of sweet potato. I said no, that was my husband's to go with his steak. She said I can get you one? I said no, not now everyone is finished and ready to leave it's late. So she said ok, just the check then?

3. She brought the check and my friend said aren't you going to get a manager or something, my friend didn't get her drink or her food. Her husband didn't get his drink and you forgot a sushi roll. She was like oh ok yeah. Comes back and said we took $31.50 off the bill. No manager came. She did apologize a few times but it just felt insincere and it felt like this was handled the wrong way. I'm disappointed that a manager never came, he was walking around but it seemed like he didn't care to stop by.  I hate to complain but I've never had something happened like this before. I eat out a lot and this experience was really bad. I hope that a manager will contact me to resolve this. I have emailed the restaurant to let them know what happened.

Decent sushi place at River North. Our server was extremely friendly and helpful. He was able to communicate with the kitchen and add some special requests for our omakase order. I definitely recommend to go with omakase if this is your first time dining in. Everything we got was outstanding and we were so full that we couldn't finish our dessert. Sashimi platter was delicious. I absolutely love the lobster tempura and seared Sea Bass!!! The red snapper tataki and beef tataki were also pretty impressive.
We'll definitely come back.

My wife and I came here to celebrate our anniversary.  Roka Akor came recommended, and we wanted a culinary treat.  We opted for the Omakase [Chef's Tasting] with the accompanying wine pairings.  

It was, without hyperbole, the best dinner of our lives. 

Our goal was to savor the food and both the chef and wait staff noticed this.  They passed along extra dishes, took extra time to explain the nuances of the courses, and made additional recommendations on how to enjoy the dishes.  They were happy to see we were enjoying the meal and we were happy to let them guide us.

Every dish was incredible; personally, I was ecstatic to have real wasabi grated over sharkskin [as Ryan, our primary server, informed us of the tradition behind this]

We were also amazed by the efficiency and knowledge of the wait staff.  Dishes seemed to disappear off of our table as soon as we finished and new dishes arrived in a timely manner, never bottlenecking. 

We were also touched by a personalized dessert platter wishing us a happy anniversary, after only finding out after we had arrived.  

Yes, this was an expensive meal, but it is also an experience my wife and I will remember for the rest of our lives.

To everyone at Roka Akor, thank you for an incredible couple of hours. Cheers.

Upon several recommendations, I finally ventured to Roka Akor last weekend.  After being warmly greeted, my companions and I were whisked away through the crowded dining room to our table.  It was around 7:45 p.m. and the place was packed.  Because of its open concept, the restaurant is on the loud side.  However, this is typical for trendy River North places.  It is not marketed as a romantic spot.  
Our server was very friendly and attentive during our visit. I wish I remembered his name.  Usually, my companions and I start off with edamame for our appetizer. However, our server suggested the robata grilled Japanese shishito peppers.  He pretty much insisted we would like them, so we ordered them, along with the grilled asparagus.  Wow was he right.  The peppers were excellent and perfectly seasoned with ponzu and bonito flakes.  The asparagus was the best I have ever had.  It was cooked to the appropriate texture and had sweet soy and sesame.  Delicious!  We ended ordering two more orders.  
Being a vegetarian, I indulged in the organic vegetable roll, while my carnivorous companions had their selections.  All of us enjoyed our meal immensely.  I could eat at Roka Akor everyday.

I'm thoroughly confused how this place has such a high average. Perhaps this business is preying upon customers that don't know better or don't care about the inherit lack of value. When the decor is better than the food... you know there is a problem.

I'll get this out of the way, the service was just fine. No issues here.

Appetiser:
tuna tataki was solid. So far so good.
Edamame... fine. but it's hard to screw this one up
seafood dumpling... decent.

Mains:
Chilean Sea Bass. $38. ~5oz fish. Thats it. No sides. Taste was a solid MEH. Sides are extra $$$. For the price and small portion of fish, it should have come complete with sides or a carb of some kind.

Tuna Four ways. $18. bland with a fishy smell. pro tip, if fish has that smell, it's not fresh. Easily one of the worst rolls i've had in a restaurant. $20 all-you-can-eat sushi places can do much better.

So i ordered $56 worth of mains to split with my partner and neither of us satisfied. 

Thank god eataly is close by to salvage the evening,

I came here for Restaurant Week with my boyfriend and my parents and we will definitely be coming back!  We started off appetizers with one of each: the Unagi Maguro Maki, the Yellowtail Sashimi with garlic ponzu, and the Rock Shrimp Tempura with Sweet Chili Aioli.  The fish in all three dishes were incredibly fresh (especially for being in the middle of Chicago winter).  The portions were also the perfect size and you definitely got the bang for your buck.

For our second courses, we got the yuzu miso marinated black cod and the NY strip loin.  The black cod came in a very unique presentation, with the fish tucked inside a giant leaf.  The NY strip was cooked a perfect temperature and the soy butter added a fun Asian flair.

Finally, for dessert, we had a warm chocolate cake with coffee ice cream.  The chocolate cake was cute with the Roka Akor label resting on top and it had a delicious chocolatey-lava-like center.  

Overall, great atmosphere, great food, great service! The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and the service was quick!

I went here for my friend's birthday. We started with complimentary Tuna Tataki. A great start to the meal. We also shared edamame and ordered cocktails. I remembered a whiskey drink I ordered at the Skokie location, but didn't see it on the menu so I asked our friendly server if it was available. Sadly it wasn't, but he suggested something similar called Honor & Glory and I was very pleased!

I ordered the Butterfish Tataki and Wagyu Beef and Kimchi Dumplings. I also tried the Crispy Brussels Sprouts, Dynamite Scallop Maki and Seared Wagyu Beef Maki. We finished the meal with Chocolate Cake, Cheesecake and Ube Pot de Creme. My friend absolutely LOVED the ube pot de creme. All their food is consistently well executed, beautifully plated and delicious. I'm never disappointed when I eat at one of their locations. 

Definitely a great restaurant to go to for a special occasion!

We went here for dinner during their soft industry night.  Anthony was our waiter and very attentive and Rich came by to make sure we were ok.  We ordered the Tuna Tartare, the Robata Pork belly, the Hamachi Crudo, and the ribeye.  We also ordered 2 glasses of sake and some sapporo.  Everything was great! the tuna with the egg was delicious.  The crudo tasted so clean and the pork omg! It was so soft and had good balance of flavor.  We will come back here again forsure!

Hard pass.

After working across the street and seeing Roka from our windows every day, I finally decided to come in for dinner.

Before I talk about the food, I want to acknowledge that the service was great. The hostess, manager and our server were all nice, with the manager even bringing us a drink to welcome us. They have that down!

Unfortunately, food flavors and quality are mediocre and incredibly overpriced. $14.50 for two bland scallops - no. Sushi platter of 6 - fish was meh. We had ordered a few plates and weren't near full but opted to grab something after as this place wasn't worth it.

I've been told the steak is what to get but we were really into trying the other plates, and were disappointed.

For incredible sashimi / sushi dishes, go to Kaizan. For Japanese robata, Sumi. Asian fusion - Sunda. The quality and flavors are incredible at these places and paying a premium is worth it.

Overpriced grocery store quality sushi. Drinks were okay, just not very strong. We went for dinner late Friday night thinking this would be a hip experience, but the music was way too loud and we were surrounded by families with young kids. This is just another tourist trap in river north- terrible quality and over priced.

I am giving them five stars and would give them more if I could. Went there for lunch today for the tasting menu. Wow. It was absolutely heavenly. We had sashimi presented in a beautiful way. The yellowtail and salmon melted in my mouth. We also had seared scallops which was in a league of its own. Sweet and meaty. Wagyu beef dumplings were divine. NY strip robata served with its own bone marrow was incredibly flavorful and melted like butter. And then the dessert platter wowowowowow!!! First the presentation was gorgeous. And then we dug in and every bite was like fireworks in my mouth. We had mango sorbet and mixed fruit sorbet which were sweet and fresh. Had the chocolate cake with coffee ice cream which was gone in five seconds. The green tea and banana pudding thing was unique and definitely my fave. Loved it!! The service was top notch.

Must try! Yes, it is pretty pricey but you're paying for the atmosphere, environment, amazing customer service, quality food, and experience overall! From beginning to end, the staff was so accommodating and helpful. I ordered the ribeye which was so delicious, I was sad when it was all gone! I do have to say that I highly regret not doing their Omakase, which means "I'll leave it to you" In Japanese. With Omakase, you pay a set price and the chef surprises you with multiple courses. Honestly, if I could go back, I'd definitely do the Omakase, so for everyone reading this, do it and let me live vicariously through you! Everyone else in my party of 10 was very happy with their food, whether they ordered sushi or fish or soups, so it sounds like you really can't go wrong here!

I've been to Roka Akor a few times now, for lunch and dinner, so it was definitely time for a review. It is hands down on my top 5 list of restaurants and dining establishments in Chicago and one of my absolute favorites. Every single dish on the menu looks impeccable, and everything I've tasted has been delightful. Cocktails, sushi, starters, entres, desserts, and the Roka Akor staff are all top-notch!

Everything we've ordered has been amazing, and a few things you must try (not in any particular order):

1. Lobster and Shrimp Dumplings
2. Lamb Cutlet with Korean Spices
3. Hamachi Serrano Chili roll
4. Rock Shrimp Tempura
5. Yuzu Miso Marinated Black Cod (exquisite)
6. Crispy Brussels Sprouts
7. Japanese Wild Mushroom Rice Hot Pot with truffle -- market price (is so worth it!)
8. Warm Chocolate Cake (my favorite dessert on the menu)
9. Yuzu Souffle Cake
10. Better Together cocktail

I cannot recommend this place enough!  The entire staff was very knowledgeable and professional.  If you want to experience exceptional dining in Chicago, you need to go to Roka Akor.

Here's the thing about going out or a fancy, 4-$ sign restaurant in a swanky part of the city... (wait for it...), good service.  Not everyone's gonna have the same or even similar expectation, but a good restaurant worth 5-stars will make it "right."

Not so at this swanky, dry ice infused, ice-gobbling eatery. Not even if you purchase the most expensive item on the menu for $129, and not even if the restaurant calls it their "decadent" dish.

Having a business dinner with four VIPs, we all order the "decadent," however, much to our dismay, when the first dish arrives, the tartar, only two plates are served for a party of five.  I give the waiter a quizzical look, and he tells me we are to share.  I tell him I'm uncomfortable about literally sharing a plate of food with someone I just met a few hours ago, and he looks at me like I've got an extra eyeball growing out of my forehead.  So, to preserve the mood, I move on and hope the next plate is a bit more tailored for individual consumption.

Not the case...

We're continuously given plates of food and dipping sauces to share amongst the four.  No serving spoon, no separation, nothing tailored for individual consumption whatsoever.  I'm disgusted and ask for an extra sauce, and the waiter slams it down in front of me while I'm attempting to have a conversation with my business partner, (and this is the best part), the waiter says "YOU'RE WELCOME." Loudly...

I attempt to ignore him, but my guests are obviously troubled by this waiter's mannerisms, or definitive lack thereof.

When I speak with the managers on duty, his response is: "well, if you had asked we would've gotten you separate plates." To which I replied, was three separate requests for individual plates not sufficient?  And does your waiter speak and understand simple English?

BYOB. 

Atmosphere is really cozy with the wood decor and dim lightining. Tables were well spaced so it didn't feel crowded. Good place for a date night.

Our server was attentive and gave good recommendations.

They have a new menu, so a lot of the recommendations in the past reviews are no longer options like the the Shishito Maguro and Lemon Salmon.

Rolls I liked from the New Menu in Order:
- Tequila
- Mafia
- Anne's Thumbs Up

Apps
- Crispy Tuna (good balance of texture and flavor)
- Uni shooter was good, but I don't know if it was worth $5. 

Dessert: Dream Bomba was really good :).

Komorebi is a go to for BYOB Sushi. Well this was my first dining experience at Komorebi but I left throughly impressed with their sushi. I was taken out for my birthday by my fiances parents who highly recommended Komorebi. 

With a smaller crowd on a Saturday night, our table of 8 enjoyed my birthday sushi byob meal ordering at least 10 rolls for the table paired with the usual suspects for sides: edamame, miso soup, salad, and crispy tuna. The usual suspects aka the side dishes were all stellar led by a delicious salad that had an incredible salad dressing, the crispy tuna was out of this world and I also enjoyed the spicy edamame!! The star of the show was the sushi. We ordered standard rolls like tuna and salmon but we also stepped our game up and ordered luxurious rolls too. The lemon salmon was spectacular and also the crispy tuna roll. Both were home-runs along with the rest of the sushi. 

I want to add that I was surprised this restaurant was not as crowded because they are in an happening area off Milwaukee in Wicker park, so the location is a winner. The service, food and interior design were also all impressive. We all thought that the interior looked more like an upscale Asian restaurant and I was treated to good service and a birthday dessert which was kind of them. Overall we all
Enjoyed everything and will plan to come back!

After trying a lot of sushi places in Chicago, I can say it with confidence : this is the best. 
The signature rolls are beautifully presented and taste amazing. 
Go for the shishito maguro, forbidden delight or anything else from that part of the menu and you will be amazed. 
The chef's special in September is Creamy lobster rolls. This is heaven. Hope it's added to the menu soon. 
Service is great and on top of that it is byob and relatively cheap.

I'm unsure what this place doesn't do six top reservations online; they literally have tables that can only seat six exactly. We made two reservations and then combined them to get our six person one.

BYOB so that's awesome, and no corking fee. I love when places do this, especially sushi, because a lot of the time they only have $$$ sake and frankly I don't need such a nice bottle of sake, I can manage on something under $15.

We shared the spicy edamame and then I split multiple items with my husband. We even splurged on some black rice. Does it taste different? Unsure. But it was fun and the fish quality overall was excellent. Sashimi, classic rolls, and a signature roll all had high quality delicious dish and flavor.

We had some issues with service where two couples finished their rolls before the third even got theirs. It was odd and they apologized profusely by it was weird.

Also, gratuity was included in the meal, which I thought was a little stiff, given that the third couple not only waited a solid 20 minutes longer for their rolls, but then got a wrong roll as a kicker.

This was our first time back since they got a new menu and we were extremely disappointed. The new menu is huge and now resembles most other BYOB sushi places... We didn't see any of the original rolls we had fallen in love with and none of the dishes stood out. We gave a few of the new rolls a try and they were mediocre. Quality of the dishes has significantly decreased. We miss the old Komorebi!

Confirmed favorite sushi spot in Chicago. 

Visited the restaurant in person for the first time (previously had ordered delivery twice) and loved it.  Came on a Sunday around 6PM and the restaurant had a lot of open seats, didn't need a reservation.  

Ordered:
1. miso soup (something about their miso soup is very umami!)
2. ocean salad.  it's actually a pretty large salad, enjoyed all the different types of seaweed in the salad
3. 7 different nigiris.  The fish is fresh, delicious, I appreciate that they put wasabi under the fish on top of the rice.  I also like the pickled ginger here a lot, it's sweeter than other places.
4. the rainbow roll and angry crab roll. I mis-remembered the size of their rolls, I thought it would be smaller so ordered 2 of these to share between 2 people, but it's actually a lot of food!  Liked the rolls too. 

Was also going to order the black seasame ice cream dessert but ended up being way too full.  Oh well, will try the dessert next time!

Overall, the restaurant is nice, food is great, and service is great.  Will definitely be back!

Able to get in here on a Friday night around 630 without reservations. We were starving and ordered right away. Food came out super quickly. The good rolls are a bit pricey but really average priced compared to yuzu and other good sushi places in the area. Service was fast and friendly. The salads are a little high priced for just a house salad. The sushi, however, was delicious. Prices are going to be expensive ($13-16) in the area for the specialty sushi options anyways, so I would recommend this place for your next sushi dinner

Hands down the best sushi in the city! 99% of the time when I go to a sushi place there will be one or two things that could have simply been done better. At Komorebi I was blown away by everything served! It is an outlier in the sub-par sushi restaurant market in Chicago. All of the rolls had a complexity of flavors, the appetizers were well thought out, and the ambiance of the restaurant itself was fantastic. The service was perfect - they cared about you as a customer but also gave you space to enjoy your meal. The price was beyond reasonable, for three people we had 4 rolls and 2 appetizers and paid $25 per person before tip. For the high quality of the food that was served it was a steal. Everything tasted unbelievably fresh. I can't recommend this place enough, it'll be my go to place for sushi now.

A couple things, first the wait staff is great. We had our 18 month old. They accommodated her, even when she was loud. They brought her children's chopsticks, her own miso, and were charming. Second, sushi was good and fresh. We ordered more than we needed and our waitress cautioned us to slow our roll. Which was helpful as we would have really overdone it. We ordered both specialty and traditional rolls, both were good. I can recommend the lettuce wraps which were spicy (a good thing) and our daughter loved the shumai (which were standard). We'll be back!

Wow that is some amazing sushi and some of the best service EVER. I've been to many sushi joints in Chicago but very few hit the mark quite like Komorebi did. Most memorable of all the sushi rolls? The lemon salmon roll. Hands down the highlight of the night, seriously drooling just thinking about it. 

Got other rolls that night that I can't quite recall all of but it included the kurobuta hamachi and also one with orange in it. Rest assured, every single one of the rolls were flavorful and absolutely delicious. The space is a little bit more cramped than I would like but nonetheless not intolerable. Easy to get a table here even on the weekends, usually no wait.

But I'd also like to note the speed of service! Good lord they are quick, all 4 or 5 of our rolls came out within 10-15 minutes of ordering. I'm sure for some people that can be moreso of a nuisance but i'm a hungry man and boy was I glad to find this place. The fastest sushi service i've ever had in my life.

Overall an excellent place for some nicer sushi. Will definitely be back sometime!

As I've said in many reviews before, Chicago is a disappointing sushi city, and Komorebi is unfortunately no exception to this trend. The 1 great thing here is the uni shooter. 

In Chicago, the issues range from lack of knowledge in keeping fish fresh for a long time, lack of traditional sushi chefs, and a majority of sushi houses being mass-production style (ex: 4+ sushi men of all ages who crank mediocre sushi out). There are not many houses who do traditional sushi (1-2 sushi chefs trained for years, focusing on consistency and quality).

Komorebi follows the modern trend. There are 3-4+ sushi men... but for whatever reason are extremely, extremely slow. They are also understaffed. Couple slow sushi men with extremely slow and haphazard waitresses, and it's a nightmare. It was so slow that the hostess began waiting tables to help... it was still painstakingly slow. 

We waited 45+ minutes for 3 rolls, sashimi, and 6 uni shooters. We almost left. Sadly, everything was mediocre, from taste to plating (sushi is served in BOWLS). We ate 1-2 pieces of each roll and left them all, because they were just really bad. They had very off and weird tastes. We had to get waitresses' attention many times to clear our plates and shooters. 

The 1 good thing here is the uni shooter (better than Kaizan's, which are too sweet. Note: I gave Kaizan a mediocre review, too). I would come back... but only for the uni shooters, and if I could order them 1 hr in advance. If this was solely an uni shooter restaurant, I would give it 4 stars but note issues with service--but since it's not and has all the above issues, I give it 2 but recommend only the uni shooters.

I get giddy every time we discover a new sushi place to add to our recurring repertoire in Chicago. Komorebi gets that distinction after our visit a few weeks ago. Hubby and I took our toddler here for an early dinner on a weeknight. It is a narrow place and dimly lit, but the decor and ambiance adds to the romantic, perfect date night vibe. 

We were seated in the back table where we could take in all the sights from the sushi bar and people watch. Thankfully they had high chairs. We started with an order of the edamame and black rice for toddler. The black rice had a slightly sweet flavor but nice not too sticky texture. Hubby and I shared the Smoky Hamachi. Presentation was dramatic with the smoke filled glass container. The yellowtail and ingredients were fresh and made a delicious flavorful unami combination. We then each had our own Chef's Picks 7 Piece Sushi and 1 Hand Roll because neither of us wanted to share. Again the pieces of fish were fresh and not cut into too thick pieces. Even the tuna was great (my judge for quality of fish since it's one of my least favorite ones). The hand roll was spicy salmon and delicious. We both inhaled every piece. Typically I don't comment on food prices in reviews since I believe good food in priceless but the prices here for the quality of sushi are really reasonable.

Can't wait to return and try some of the other menu offerings...or reorder everything above again.

O-M-G! Great BYOB sushi joint in a not-so-conspicuous spot. What's better? Take your toddler, make it a date night, or BOTH. We arrived around 5:30 pm on a Saturday night. Most of the tables by the window were full. We were seated near the back since we had our baby. No complaints. I get it. 

Started off with a few pieces of nigiri and edamame. Then, we ordered a cucumber/avocado roll for the little one, and the fiesta and spicy tuna rolls for the adults. NOW, onto the best part- the shishito maguro signature roll. I legit wanted to lick the entire plate clean. Hands down one of the best sushi rolls I have ever encountered. 

Service=A-OK!

No words to express how excited my fianc and I are to have this AMAZING new sushi place just a few blocks from our home. Our new favorite spot!! We will be back here all the time. The fish was fresh, friendly and fast service, great atmosphere, INCREDIBLY DELCIOUS food... we loved and devoured every single thing we ordered... our waitress was so friendly and sweet. Loved her. And the owner was even nice enough to send out a free sample of the sesame ice cream to try!!! I would recommend this place to anyone. We will be back... a lot!!! Love this place!!!!

Their sesame ice cream dessert was quite delectable. The ice cream has strong sesame flavor. Sesame brittle adds loose crunchy texture that complements well with its black sesame centric theme. Flavor profile was excellent! The Japanese wooden name plate also added touch of authenticity to the restaurant, although I believe the staff and sushi chefs are Korean. Nothing wrong with that, there are just far fewer Japanese people residing in the Midwest.

Again yelp why are you so stingy with your stars??? Usually I complain about the half stars but this time around Komorebi demands about 12 of them. No review that I will write will do justice to the rolls that I had and the service that was provided. 

I knew that after last years Valentine's day disaster at Maple and Ash I wanted to go to a completely different place so I can actually enjoy my time with the husband. My friend suggested Komorebi and we called on the 13th and were able to get reservations at 7. When we sat down they gave us the option of having a semi preset menu or just picking from the actual menu. My husband is not the venturing type when it comes to sushi so we ordered from the actual menu. Our choices were: spicey edamame, miso hot soup, tuna poke, lemon salmon roll, cruncheese, caterpillar, soft shell, and ice cream. First of all the specialty signature rolls are to die for. They all sounded amazing but I had to pick safe cooked dishes. I wasn't upset because everything we ordered was so fresh and really delicious. I think they may have an aquarium in the back where they fish from. On to the service! Stella was our server and to say she was professional and well mannered would be an understatement. She was fantastic and really took care of us. The place is a great restaurant all around. So worth trying!

I mainly eat around Logan, Bucktown and Ukrainian Village and this is place is high on my list. 

I had to try one of the signature rolls because they're all so unique. I tried the Fuji salmon and I find myself craving it all the time now. 

The service was super friendly and quick, and I love the eclectic cozy feel of the restaurant. 

It's also BYOB. Excited to try more from here.

Oh my LORD this place is absolutely AMAZING!!!!!!!

I've had a ton of sushi in my life and the sushi here has by far been the BEST I have ever had, even compared to sushi restaurants that are way higher in price. My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place when we saw the "grand opening" sign and decided to try it. Best decision ever.

First off, the interior is very romantic. I would definitely recommend this place for a first date or if you want to impress someone. The decor is warm, plush and inviting. 

The staff, from the moment we entered, was incredibly welcoming and it felt very sincere. Our server knew the menu well and answered our questions and gave her own opinions on items as well. She was a total doll and the other waitstaff were very attentive as well.

Now the food is what is most important. We ordered the Scorpion roll which was seared spicy tuna on top of soft shell crab with tobiko on top. It melted in our mouths. It was SO flavorful my eyes were rolling back. Get this roll. 

Next we tried the Tsukemono Saba roll which had binchotan charcoal seared mackerel over spicy crab, cucumber, avocado roll with Japanese pickle salsa drizzled with ponzu and chili oil. This also, melted in our mouths. The flavors just danced with each other and everything was just so tantalizing. The presentation was also beautiful 

I think what sets this place apart from the rest is that the chefs use their own unique and special sauces for the rolls. The server told us that we should try the sushi without soy sauce first because the chefs already use special sauces for the rolls. We tried it and they were right--no soy sauce needed. This creates a very unique tasting experience and it really shows how skilled these sushi chefs are

For dessert we had the Yuzu, which was Yuzu fluffy Japanese cheesecake, yuzu meringue cookies, strawberry puree, yuzu cookie crumb, shaved white chocolate 

Honestly we were just in heaven tonight. The whole experience was amazing and it just proves that you don't have to pay an arm and a leg for excellent sushi. This place is better than any of the over hyped restaurants downtown in river north that just boast big $$$ but fall short on flavor. We definitely found our new happy place and will be back asap. 

We also gave our regards to the sushi chefs when we were leaving and they were the nicest, warmest and most gracious chefs ever. I know this place will become ridiculously successful and am so happy that they have joined the neighborhood 

I can't rave enough about this place. Love love LOVE

I don't write reviews on yelp anymore because for most restaurants, the ratings are quite accurate and I don't see the necessity in contributing my stars to them. However,,, since this place just opened, I'll pave the way for y'all. 

Other than at higher end Chicago area sushi restaurants, such as Momotaro, Juno, Katsu, etc., I swear I have NEVER had sushi in this town that comprises the absolute essentials of quality sushi: flavor, texture, freshness, and the perfect balance of the three. Komorebi succeeds at meeting all four with adding a refreshing twist of its own, all whilst filling the stomach, without emptying your pockets.

Now, let's talk kitchen food. If you're a foodie and/or a home chef, you know how difficult it is to come across that juicy, tender, succulent pork tenderloin that just melts inside your mouth - leaving you shocked and sad that it has left your mouth so soon fo yo stomach? Komorebi's pork tenderloin katsu will make you cry and your mouth jizz with excess saliva. 

I'd love to write about all the dishes  I've tried, which is a lot (please see photos), but I'd rather not bore you any longer with my wordiness. All in all, the service is great, the food is well-balanced and spectacular (there is not a single complaint I have with their food), the price range is more than reasonable, and there is ample street parking available in the area.

Just go.

This is an incredible new BYOB sushi spot located on the Milwaukee strip of bars and restaurants. The decor catches your eye immediately, as it is one part vintage/antique and another part Japanese garden. The staff brought the food out timely and showed excellent attentiveness; we felt highly appreciated as customers.  Our first course was the delicious spicy edamame, which came out hot and well seasoned. The spicy miso soup didn't disappoint either, as it had substance and a good kick to it. Ordering the sushi was tough because their specialty rolls were unique and all sounded so appetizing. We started with the Tequila and Spicy Tataki rolls, which were both fresh tasting and wonderfully flavored. The Tataki plate came out flaming which was a creative touch, only to be dwarfed by our last roll which was adorably arranged to look like a turtle (the roll's namesake). Overall Kamerabi deserves high praise, as it blends an avant garde menu with fresh tasting ingredients and a courteous staff. We will definitely be dining here again!

Wow!  Can I give you more than 5 stars?!? I absolutely love Komorebi and wish I could eat here everyday! Such a small cute restaurant with a relaxed vibe.  I'm always sad it's not very crowded when I go there.  I have never had trouble getting a table.  The lemon salmon is the best sushi roll I've ever had.  All their signature rolls are extremely fresh, succulent, and delish!  The presentation of their rolls is always on point.  And BYOB too!

This creates a very unique tasting experience and it really shows how skilled these sushi chefs are

For dessert we had the Yuzu, which was Yuzu fluffy Japanese cheesecake, yuzu meringue cookies, strawberry puree, yuzu cookie crumb, shaved white chocolate 

Honestly we were just in heaven tonight. The whole experience was amazing and it just proves that you don't have to pay an arm and a leg for excellent sushi. This place is better than any of the over hyped restaurants downtown in river north that just boast big $$$ but fall short on flavor. We definitely found our new happy place and will be back asap. 

We also gave our regards to the sushi chefs when we were leaving and they were the nicest, warmest and most gracious chefs ever. I know this place will become ridiculously successful and am so happy that they have joined the neighborhood 

I can't rave enough about this place. Love love LOVE

Absolutely a gem. 
Very cozy place with cute chairs.
Their Saba roll was the best in chicago and everything was so fresh!
I would definitely recommend sesame seed ice cream for the dessert. 
Exceptional service. 
Can't wait to go back and try all the dishes on the menu!!

I don't write reviews on yelp anymore because for most restaurants, the ratings are quite accurate and I don't see the necessity in contributing my stars to them. However,,, since this place just opened, I'll pave the way for y'all. 

Other than at higher end Chicago area sushi restaurants, such as Momotaro, Juno, Katsu, etc., I swear I have NEVER had sushi in this town that comprises the absolute essentials of quality sushi: flavor, texture, freshness, and the perfect balance of the three. Komorebi succeeds at meeting all four with adding a refreshing twist of its own, all whilst filling the stomach, without emptying your pockets.

Now, let's talk kitchen food. If you're a foodie and/or a home chef, you know how difficult it is to come across that juicy, tender, succulent pork tenderloin that just melts inside your mouth - leaving you shocked and sad that it has left your mouth so soon fo yo stomach? Komorebi's pork tenderloin katsu will make you cry and your mouth jizz with excess saliva. 

I'd love to write about all the dishes  I've tried, which is a lot (please see photos), but I'd rather not bore you any longer with my wordiness. All in all, the service is great, the food is well-balanced and spectacular (there is not a single complaint I have with their food), the price range is more than reasonable, and there is ample street parking available in the area.

Just go.

This is an incredible new BYOB sushi spot located on the Milwaukee strip of bars and restaurants. The decor catches your eye immediately, as it is one part vintage/antique and another part Japanese garden. The staff brought the food out timely and showed excellent attentiveness; we felt highly appreciated as customers.  Our first course was the delicious spicy edamame, which came out hot and well seasoned. The spicy miso soup didn't disappoint either, as it had substance and a good kick to it. Ordering the sushi was tough because their specialty rolls were unique and all sounded so appetizing. We started with the Tequila and Spicy Tataki rolls, which were both fresh tasting and wonderfully flavored. The Tataki plate came out flaming which was a creative touch, only to be dwarfed by our last roll which was adorably arranged to look like a turtle (the roll's namesake). Overall Kamerabi deserves high praise, as it blends an avant garde menu with fresh tasting ingredients and a courteous staff. We will definitely be dining here again!

Wow!  Can I give you more than 5 stars?!? I absolutely love Komorebi and wish I could eat here everyday! Such a small cute restaurant with a relaxed vibe.  I'm always sad it's not very crowded when I go there.  I have never had trouble getting a table.  The lemon salmon is the best sushi roll I've ever had.  All their signature rolls are extremely fresh, succulent, and delish!  The presentation of their rolls is always on point.  And BYOB too!

I've been to Komorebi numerous times and had always loved it.  I went back on Saturday and was surprised that they completely changed their menu.  I'm not sure if they changed owners but it is definitely not the same quality as before.

Service: Our server was fantastic. She was attentive, but not overbearing. She was also listening to us (without us asking) - I know it sounds weird, but she was very thoughtful in her recommendations based on items we have ordered and catered to our taste. I haven't had such phenomenal service in a while, I should've asked for her name but it was on a Friday evening on June 16th. 

Food: I am selfish and want this place to myself.... however I must say this is my new go to restaurant! I loved the food, the fish was fresh (especially the hamachi!). Also, sometimes the chef special rolls at restaurants all taste the same, I would say that the rolls uniquely taste different from each other. Please get the smoky hamachi appetizer. 

Atmosphere: I am always skeptical of BYOB places, because they tend to always get a 4 or 5 star rating and the food is just mediocre, that is not true for this restaurant. They do not squeeze you in like sardines, the tables are spaciously spaced apart and the decor is great. 

5 Stars for all 3.

Came here Friday night with my husband and another couple and had a really lovely time. Got a great seat right up front. Do note that this place has a large communal table, so if you don't like that sorta thing (I hate them, personally) make sure you note that when you make a reservation. Anyway the service was great. Our waitress was attentive and funny. The food was excellent, we ordered so many rolls lol. Prices were good. I will say our usual sushi place is Yuzu and their rolls seem larger for sure, however these ones are good-sized. We will definitely come back. Plus it's BYOB which is always awesome.

Holy cowabunga! That was some of the freshest sushi I've ever had in chicago. What stood out to me the most was that you could tell the chef cares about the ingredients he uses in his dishes and assembles each piece with care. 

They had me sold at the spicy miso soup. 

And it only got better with each dish we ordered:
- spicy seafood. Sushi with pumpernickel WHATTTT WHO THINKS OF THIS. 
- lemon salmon. Perfect blend of tart, sweet, savory, textures #dead
- Kurobuta hamachi: heat and soy and crunch and silkiness and yummmmmmmm
- Tsukemono Saba: seared mackerel perfection 

Ladies and gents, this is definitely not your standard byob sushi place that just happens to be in your neighborhood. This is a standout. A real gem. A restaurant with a staff and a chef that genuinely cares. 

Five star and many praises. I'm in love. Would like to live here if I could.

Adorable sushi restaurant with the cutest waitress.  We were the only ones in the on a Sunday at 5.... how is this place not more well known?!? Found them on Yelp and decided to come in.  I like this place way better than Yuzu - more unique and fun touches to some dishes like smoked hamachi (covered in a glass bowl of smoke when it comes to your table) and rolls with truffle oil. Sushi was really fresh and rolls were good too.  Highly recommended!

For 30 years we ate at Itto Sushi. The best ever in Chicago. But Juco SAN retired last April. We haven't had sushi since. But a new place just opened a half block from us. Wonderful!

All the reasons why we love Komorebi: 1) great quality fish, superior to your typical sushi bar, in artistic presentations; 2) generous pieces; 3) great service; 4) beautiful atmosphere; and 5) BYOB!  We are great aficionados of traditional sushi and this place hits all of our sweet spots.  If you are looking for Japanese food that avoids the gimmicks and delivers an authentic experience, come to Komorebi.

There should be a word for the elation one feels when a phenomenal sushi spot opens mere footsteps from your home.  If it did exist, it'd make for the perfect opening to this review.

The fish at Komorebi is fresh, delicate, and tasty.  From the zuke salmon nigiri to my common measuring stick of a yellowtail scallion roll, Komorebi delivered.  

But where they shine is with their signature and special rolls.  We tried three.  Each blends disparate and delicious parts into marvelous wholes.  The Hirame Obba Roll brought some heat and the fluke mixed incredibly well with the spicy tuna.  The Dragon Roll was like other ebi/unagi rolls, but better.  Finally, the Kurobuta Hamachi Roll was absurd.  How have I never had tiny amounts of bacon subtly folded into a sushi roll before?  I wish I had ordered one of these to go. 

Finally, the atmosphere is A+.  Long slats of wood stacked up to a very high ceiling complement the elegantly plain wooden tables and the tables and artfully mismatching chairs by the window.

Welcome to Wicker Park Komorebi!  We are grateful to have you.

Seriously, everything was perfect.  The waitress was knowledgeable and gave great recommendations.  This byob neighborhood sushi spot is the best one around.

Totally digging this place!

The food
Got the following:

Crispy tuna
Couple next to me was not a fan of this but I really liked it. I love the crunch of the rice and the really good tuna. Also super easy to eat with your hands! Love it.

Smoky Hamachi
Meh - Couple next to me recommended it and honestly it was more show than anything. Sure it's cool to see the smoke but seriously not worth it. I would not get this.


Spicy Tuna Roll
#2 favorite. So everyone has a spicy tuna roll but something about this was just awesome! I am still thinking about this alone and will be the primary factor I will be coming back! Fantastic balance of flavors and textures.

Salmon Roll
Why oh why do sushi places lately decided putting a lemon on a roll is a great idea? I hate it! I feel it takes away from the taste of the fish and way to overpowering. Not a huge fan of salmon either but I tried one piece and I was done.

Kurogoma
If only this was served everywhere!! I love black sesame ice cream and this was fantastic!! The crunchy pieces combined with the rest of the dessert was simply fantastic! The highlight of the night!



The ambience
A few large tables and really meant for group gatherings but you quickly make friends with people sitting next to you. Super romantic with the dark lighting and I believe it's a BYOB!



The service
Super quick and friendly. Even made room for us at last minute on a Friday night. Will be coming back for sure!

Tried this place out recently after learning about it through yelp and was very impressed. We only got to try some rolls this time but each one was so delicious and unique. I highly recommend the angry crab and lemon salmon makis. The quality of the fish was excellent and each roll was very flavorful. The fish to rice ratio was also on point. 
I kept thinking to myself that the sushi was so much tastier and fresher than the other options nearby. I am already excited to return to try more dishes off the menu! Plus, it's byob!

Overall great sushi with a nice, intimate setting!

Food: Many things on the menu are unique and delicious.  The Orange Salmon has a good kick of sweetness mixed in with the classic sushi taste.  Really liked the Saikyo Yaki which is a cooked salmon dish, perfect for people who don't like raw fish.  All of their rolls are delicious and there is definitely something on the menu for everyone.

Ambience: Dimly lit with very nice, clean, rustic tables and decor.  Perfect for date night or dinner with your closest friends.  Music that is not too loud but fills in the awkward silences of conversations nicely.

Service: Waiters / waitresses explain everything they are bringing out and give great recommendations.  Always had water on our table.  Very satisfied.

In general, a very nice, new sushi place in Wicker Park with quality food and great service!

P.S. Major plus in that the bathrooms are clean!

Awesome BYO sushi place in Wicker Park. Went on a Friday night with my girlfriend and had a great experience. Atmosphere is cozy with exposed bring, making it feel more like a tavern than a sushi restaurant. 
The crispy tuna appetizer was so good we ordered another round of it with our main rolls and sashimi. It had good spice without being overwhelming and the pan seared crunch of the rice had great chew. 
The sashimi was large, really fresh. We had salmon and yellowtail.
I also really like the angry crab roll because it wasn't overly sauced to the point where you couldn't taste what was going on in it - big plus.

Amazing new sushi spot, it's my new go to.  One of those places that makes you feel good when you walk in. Not only was it some of the freshest sushi we've ever had, but the staff was incredibly friendly.  We ordered: Hamachi Tartare, Chef's Choice 6 piece Sashimi - beautiful presentation, Hirame Obba - great spice, Tsukemono Saba and the black sesame ice cream for dessert.  Everything we had was delicious, and it was coursed out perfectly.  

The restaurant hasn't been open very long, and you could tell they were a little understaffed.  This did not take away from the experience at all.  The servers never seemed flustered and were very engaging.  Our plates were cleared as soon as they were done and we were never without what we needed.  This place is BYOB, and while there is a Jewel right across the street (limited selection), I recommend heading to the Garden Gourmet Market a little down Ashland and getting a bottle of sake.  $20 and chilled in the cooler waiting.

Yes yes yes!!!

Every dish has a well balanced flavors.  From citrus to pearls popping with flavors.  Each dish is thought out.

Sushi and more...definitely more then just sushi.

Their desserts are fantasic.

I say start out with Orange Salmon.  Finish with sesame ice cream or Yuzu cheesecake. (If you get both make sure eat cheesecake first because the extra sweet flavors of the ice cream)

I need to go back and try every specialty rolls and appetizers.

Tried about 10 dishes, and so far no hint of dissatisfaction.

Best part BYOB, and if you bring your own saki they warm it up for you!

Went here on a Saturday night on a date.  The atmosphere is really nice...not exactly romantic but definitely upscale and date worthy.  The foods was decent but not spectacular: Absolutely loved the edamame (they put some sort of citrus juice on it), the hamachi tartar was very tasty but was really small and could've used some chips to place it on, the dragon roll was a little soggy and didn't have the crispness I would like, and the fiesta roll had a good flavor albeit a little dry.  The service was a bit of a letdown...our server came over right away after my date had arrived and before she'd had a chance to peruse the menu, and then after that getting a hold of our server was difficult...we kept trying to flag her down and so were a bunch of other tables so it was hard to get her attention.

Not a bad place, and I wouldn't object to going there again if somebody suggested it.  But I probably won't be suggesting it myself.  Sushi competition is fierce!

Komorebi is my favorite sushi place in the Wicker Park neighborhood.  It's unpretentious and BYOB making the sushi experience much more affordable and pleasant.  Bring a nice bottle of rose and it'll go so well with the sushi!  Everything I have had here has been absolutely delicious.  My two favorites are the: Hon Maguro Poke appetizer, the spicy miso soup, and the Tsukemono Saba. The Hon Maguro Poke has a soy truffle vinaigrette that pairs so well with the balsamic glaze on top.  The tuna is perfectly prepared and is complemented well with the avocado that is not too overpowering.  The spicy miso soup is just delightful, it's very flavorful.  The Tsukemono Saba sushi roll has smoked mackerel with avocado and a great lite Japanese pickle salsa with ponzu and chili oil.  I love smoked fish dearly so this roll is very satisfying and all of the ingredients go very ell together.  I like that they are very creative with how they pair their ingredients.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the service is a little awkward sometimes, but their food is five stars for sure.

Food was honestly fakin amazing and was ready nice and quickly.  Amazing spicy edamame and miso soup.  The girls thought the caterpillar roll was mmk but everything else tickled their fancy.  

Honestly, spicy miso and edamame so yummy.  And the chefs choice sushimi was killer.  Only reason for 4 instead of 5 is we waited light years to get the attention of our very sweet and friendly waitress.  I tried to make eye contact w her for like 8 minutes.  Nbd I would give 4.5 if I could 5 for the food.  Thanks!!

Miso hungry! 

Spicy Miso soup is outstanding! 10 stars 
We really wanted to order the spicy seafood and the server recommended the poke which was good but I want to go back and try the spicy seafood now 

Spicy tuna could've had a little more kick. 
Rainbow was fresh and delicious!  

We had one of their signature rolls, it was our least favorite (hence the four stars)

Komorebi sushi was delicious. The atmosphere is awesome, very reminiscent of other sushi places I've experienced, but new and clean, fresh. Just like the food. Very fresh and mouth watering.

I ordered the Hon Maguro Poke to start, a recommendation by our waitress, Naya. It was very light and a good taste of what else was to come.

Next, I had the spicy miso soup. best spicy miso I've ever had, by far!

We ordered a variety of specialty rolls, one of the highlights was the Fiesta roll. I can't wait to go back and try the Lemon Salmon roll. The Kurogoma, black sesame ice cream was a refreshingly delicious end to a great sushi dinner.

The service was great and overall, I would recommend a visit to Komorebi if you love delicious sushi. Ps. BYOB!

Have tiny angels ever danced on your taste buds before?  Have you ever thought, "I would give a year of my life to know such sweet pleasure again"?  Have you ever asked a sushi roll "Where have you been all my life?" and waited for an answer?

If not, you haven't been to Komorebi.

Now, I am no sushi aficionado.  I'm psychotically picky and knowledgeable about my ribeyes, but not sushi.  When people debate spectacular vs. great vs. bad sushi my eyes glaze over like I'm being forced to watch a football game.  When it comes to sushi, I've always felt that as long as it hasn't gone bad...it's all good!  However, as the meticulously planned flavors at Komorebi affectionately embraced my taste buds, my outlook completely changed.  I now know that all sushi is NOT created equally!  And, sushi can be addictive.

My dinner companion had been visiting Komorebi like some sort of strung-out sushi addict (four times in the past month), so I followed her lead on what to order.  We began our sushi trip with the Crispy Tuna appetizer.  The tuna, fresh and flavorful, luxuriated on a bed of crispy rice so delectable it seemed each individual grain had been cooked up individually to acquire the perfect amount of crispiness.  I had a hit of Unagi on the side, which was good, but not great.  We continued with the Kurubuta Hamachi and Seafood crunch rolls.  Being a bit of a purist at times, I didn't think I would appreciate my yellowtail being cut with bacon.  Oh was I wrong!  These are not large bites of bacon, but tiny bits that delicately flavor the roll.  As for the Seafood crunch, loved it!  So spectacular it set my teeth on edge.  Not knowing our limits, we also ordered the Lemon Salmon roll.  This delicacy was like rolling in a green field on the first day of spring while "The Age of Aquarius" flows down from the heavens.

Though we had gone in on the deal 50/50, I accidentally broke sushi protocol for the first time in my life. Each roll had 8 pieces, 4 for each of us...but I scored 5 pieces from each roll.  My guilt was undeniable, deep...and quickly disappeared.  

When it was time for desert, everything had become a bit hazy.  We may have ordered the Kurogoma, or we may not have.  I suffered a sushi overdose after the Lemon Salmon and simply do not recall.

I do recall that I loved the dcor in Komorebi.  The exposed brick, hardwood floors, reproduction chairs in the front half of the restaurant, high-top tables in the back, all created a comfortable and chic atmosphere.  The service was impeccable and friendly - I received hugs from the sushi chef and owner before leaving.  What a wonderful sushi fix this was!  I'll definitely be back again and again and again and...

Amazing new sushi spot, it's my new go to.  One of those places that makes you feel good when you walk in. Not only was it some of the freshest sushi we've ever had, but the staff was incredibly friendly.  We ordered: Hamachi Tartare, Chef's Choice 6 piece Sashimi - beautiful presentation, Hirame Obba - great spice, Tsukemono Saba and the black sesame ice cream for dessert.  Everything we had was delicious, and it was coursed out perfectly.  

The restaurant hasn't been open very long, and you could tell they were a little understaffed.  This did not take away from the experience at all.  The servers never seemed flustered and were very engaging.  Our plates were cleared as soon as they were done and we were never without what we needed.  This place is BYOB, and while there is a Jewel right across the street (limited selection), I recommend heading to the Garden Gourmet Market a little down Ashland and getting a bottle of sake.  $20 and chilled in the cooler waiting.

Yes yes yes!!!

Every dish has a well balanced flavors.  From citrus to pearls popping with flavors.  Each dish is thought out.

Sushi and more...definitely more then just sushi.

Their desserts are fantasic.

I say start out with Orange Salmon.  Finish with sesame ice cream or Yuzu cheesecake. (If you get both make sure eat cheesecake first because the extra sweet flavors of the ice cream)

I need to go back and try every specialty rolls and appetizers.

Tried about 10 dishes, and so far no hint of dissatisfaction.

Best part BYOB, and if you bring your own saki they warm it up for you!

Love the people here too and the vibe of farm fresh, rustic ambiance.

Sushi and much much more!

I'm genuinely excited about this new Japanese restaurant and can't wait to make it our go-to place for inventive and delicious sushi.

Every dish had something that made it more interesting and flavorful than expected.
You can almost see and taste how much thought and detail the chef puts into preparing every dish.

Freshness and quality of the fish served here was incredible.
Toro and Uni was available the night we went and they were as fresh and tasteful as can be.
Even the nori (seaweed) used for the nigiri and rolls was higher quality compared to other restaurants in the city.
Freshly grated wasabi accompanying sashimi orders showed how detailed and thoughtful this place is about their food.

Some of the dishes we tried:
-Hon Maguro Poke with soy truffle vinaigrette and taro chips - we love good poke and this version with taro chips was excellent.

-Smoky Hamachi - served under a glass cover with smoke that's released once the dish is served was such a great presentation and added another layer of smoky flavor that enhanced the flavors of yellowtail. 

-Shishito Maguro - Fresh Tuna and Yellowtail with shishito pepper roll with truffle vinaigrette - hint of truffle flavor with shishito pepper complemented well without overpowering the fish.

-Kurobuta Hamachi - Yellowtail over bits of bacon, wasabi tobiko drizzled with ponzu - super creative and delicious.  Never thought bacon and yellowtail could go so well together.

-Tsukemono Saba - Charcoal seared mackerel over spicy crab, cucumber, avocado roll with ponzu and chili oil - you don't see rolls with mackerel in Chicago but this charcoal seared mackerel with chili oil had me ordering seconds.

I would definitely recommend EVERYTHING from their signature rolls section of the menu.

Even desserts, Black sesame ice cream with sesame brittle and black sesame honey, as well as Yuzu cake with yuzu meringue cookies and shaved white chocolate showed much creativity and great execution. 
We were told the desserts were made from scratch in-house and both dessert dishes were a big hit with our table.

Overall impression:
Food is inventive, fresh, delicate, and flavorful.
Service is attentive, prompt, and thoughtful.
Interior with open dining room with high ceilings but still feels intimate and cozy.

We can't wait to go back!

Went here for a birthday dinner, after finding out this is a new location opened by the owners of Rollapalooza(amazing sushi place as well!) in boystown. Waitress was a bit slow but friendly. It's byob and they promptly opened the wine bottle for us. The owner greeted us towards the end of the dinner and gave us sesame ice cream on the house for the celebrations! The sashimi was amazing and the fish was the freshest I have had in chicago. All of their dishes were made with care, and the presentation was perfect. Highly recommend their specialty rolls, I don't think you can go wrong here with anything.

If you're a fan of specialty rolls, this is the place to go! I ordered the kamikaze roll and the angry soft shell roll and they were some of the best specialty rolls I've ever had. They were creatively well executed and just melted in the mouth.  I also got the 6 piece sashimi which was fine, but the real star here is the specialty rolls.  And for the quality of the sushi and the amount that you're getting, the prices here are really not bad at all.

I will def come back again and try some of the other rolls on the menu. But Komorebi is so far my favorite good quality sushi restaurant in Chicago.  The only bummer is that they don't serve alcohol!

Came here yesterday night for my birthday dinner with my husband. Really liked the mismatched chairs theme with a heavy influence of wood in the decor and hanging industrial chandeliers with exposed bulbs. Waitresses were very sweet and had a good attitude- always a bonus. Menus were on a wooden clipboard which, in a pair, were a tad large for the two seater table. They happily put our BYOB white wine in an ice bucket and topped off the ice at my request. We started off with the Smoky Himachi appetizer, with 4 slices of the fish enclosed in a cloche that captured some sort of wood infused smoke. Very striking. We moved on to the Chefs choice of a 6 piece sashimi set- ended up with two thick slices each of salmon, tuna, himachi and a white fish. Yup, the chef did throw in an extra two slices of fish, a gesture I appreciate. For mains, I chose the Shishito Maguro roll and my husband got the charcoal seared saba fish roll. My personal preference leaned towards the saba fish roll but I did enjoy the Shishito roll as well. The best part of the dinner for me was dessert! The Yuzu cheesecake was unbelievably good. I almost licked plate clean and actually contemplated ordering a second portion. Oh, and interestingly, the water carafe had a small piece of charcoal, apparently it purifies the water. All in all, had a good time and definitely recommend this place for good fresh sushi at reasonable prices. This entire meal cost us around 72 (excluding tip). Two things I would recommend to improve is to slightly dim the lights for the evening crowd and may be offer a complimentary dessert for special occasions like a birthday. Good job!

First time at this spot. Super friendly staff and there wasn't anything we didn't like. The lemon salmon roll was the best thing we ate here. Definitely coming back.

I loved everything we tried (which was almost one of everything)! The fish tasted fresh and all the rolls were so creative. The only downfall of this restaurant is how slow the service is. Our waitress always had to be flagged down when we wanted to order more food and the sushi came out impossibly slowly. I would definitely come back for the sushi though, mmmm

Terrible service. It had been 30 minutes since we sat down with no one tending to us, so I had to get up and requests wine glasses myself and the table next to us that sat down before we did. After we ordered, another 30 minutes for edamame!! Our waitress' attitude was incredibly rude. Food is nothing to write home about and certainly isn't worth the poor service. Won't be going back.

Went here for a birthday dinner, after finding out this is a new location opened by the owners of Rollapalooza(amazing sushi place as well!) in boystown. Waitress was a bit slow but friendly. It's byob and they promptly opened the wine bottle for us. The owner greeted us towards the end of the dinner and gave us sesame ice cream on the house for the celebrations! The sashimi was amazing and the fish was the freshest I have had in chicago. All of their dishes were made with care, and the presentation was perfect. Highly recommend their specialty rolls, I don't think you can go wrong here with anything.

If you're a fan of specialty rolls, this is the place to go! I ordered the kamikaze roll and the angry soft shell roll and they were some of the best specialty rolls I've ever had. They were creatively well executed and just melted in the mouth.  I also got the 6 piece sashimi which was fine, but the real star here is the specialty rolls.  And for the quality of the sushi and the amount that you're getting, the prices here are really not bad at all.

I will def come back again and try some of the other rolls on the menu. But Komorebi is so far my favorite good quality sushi restaurant in Chicago.  The only bummer is that they don't serve alcohol!

Best sushi for the money, "period" - to quote Sean Spicer. Cool atmosphere, really awesome and innovative food, and the service is amazing. Go here. Seriously, go here. We live in the neighborhood and need this place to stay open forever. I don't even care if it gets so popular, we have to wait in line. It's that good.

Came here yesterday night for my birthday dinner with my husband. Really liked the mismatched chairs theme with a heavy influence of wood in the decor and hanging industrial chandeliers with exposed bulbs. Waitresses were very sweet and had a good attitude- always a bonus. Menus were on a wooden clipboard which, in a pair, were a tad large for the two seater table. They happily put our BYOB white wine in an ice bucket and topped off the ice at my request. We started off with the Smoky Himachi appetizer, with 4 slices of the fish enclosed in a cloche that captured some sort of wood infused smoke. Very striking. We moved on to the Chefs choice of a 6 piece sashimi set- ended up with two thick slices each of salmon, tuna, himachi and a white fish. Yup, the chef did throw in an extra two slices of fish, a gesture I appreciate. For mains, I chose the Shishito Maguro roll and my husband got the charcoal seared saba fish roll. My personal preference leaned towards the saba fish roll but I did enjoy the Shishito roll as well. The best part of the dinner for me was dessert! The Yuzu cheesecake was unbelievably good. I almost licked plate clean and actually contemplated ordering a second portion. Oh, and interestingly, the water carafe had a small piece of charcoal, apparently it purifies the water.

So happy this opened around the corner from us. Went for the first time last night and thought it was just as good as Yuzu (our "go to" sushi place). Very friendly service. Interesting rolls and some combinations I haven't seen before.   We had the smoked hamachi appetizer , lemon salmon roll, and crazy soft shell roll.  I would order every one of these again but anxious to try other options.  Welcome to the hood!

New favorite sushi spot! The place is so cute inside and the sushi is amazing and not over priced like every place in rivernorth.   I went with a group and we ordered a bunch of rolls but my two favorite were the fiesta and smokey hamachi.   Our server Tiffany was really helpful in helping us pick out our order and she suggested the sesame ice cream which was soooo good.    Will def be going back

Every sushi restaurant should make spicy miso soup. The spicy seafood appetizer and sushi are delicious! End with the black sesame desert.

Outstanding. Absolutely loved the vibe of this place, and the food was the highlight. I rarely write reviews, but this place was deserving. Beautiful presentation and creative options...like the smoked hamachi, set under a glass filled with wood smoke. The flavor was unlike anything I have tried before. And the salmon rolls with a lemon sauce...unreal. I was there for a business meeting and it was quiet enough to talk, but the music was an enjoyable part of the ambiance. Will be back as soon as possible.

This place is by far the best Sushi I've had in Chicago. From the staff to the ambiance and of course the food is on point. Lemon salmon roll was so refreshing and fresh that it doesn't even need soy sauce. Can't wait to come again.

Seriously the best sushi in town. We've been here twice in two weeks and were blown away both times!  We had an Alaskan, Kamikaze, Saba. All amazing. Edamame has amazing seasoning. People need to try this place!  Incredible!

Some of the fresher, more creative house specialties I have tasted at any sushi place. Spicy garlic edamame and spicy miso soup both fantastic. Attentive service from both waitress and owner. First time dining there but I will make this part of my regular sushi rotation. A must-try for all Chicago sushi lovers!

Delicious and innovative sushi rolls (and this is coming from someone who is not a huge sushi fan). Lemon salmon roll is a must. Plus this place is BYOB. On top of it all service is excellent, and they were incredibly accommodating to our little kids. Can't wait to go back!
